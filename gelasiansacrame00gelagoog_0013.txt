THIS edition of the Gelasian Sacramentary was originally
taken in hand in order to provide, for the use of persons ·
studying the Western service-books, a text more convenient
and more easily accessible than those os the earlier editione,
and more accurate than that which is included in Migne's
patrologia Latina. For this purpose it was at first proposed
to reproduce Tommasi’s text, with an introduction, and possibly
with notes critical and explanatory. Before adopting this
course, however, it seemed desirable to examine not only the
Vatican manuscript Reginae 316, from which Tommasi's text
was taken, but also other manuscript authorities. The result of
this examination was an enlargement of the original design.
The Sacramentaries of Rheinau and S. Gallen proved not only
to be likely to furnish better means os emending the text of
the Vatican MS. than those which were at the disposal of
Tommasi or Vezzosi, but to be themselves of such importance
as to warrant an· endeavour to make their contentS, their
arrangement, and their text more fully known. The task of
comparing these later ‘ Gelasian ’ Sacramentaries with the
earlier text of the Vatican MS. has been a slow and laborious
one, since the differences of arrangement made it somewhat
hard to trace‚ in the different recensionS, the· matter common to
the three MSS.; even now, though the greater part os the
contents of the text has been traced in one or both of the later
