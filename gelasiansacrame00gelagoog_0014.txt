 

vi PREFACE.

‘ Gelasian ¹ books, it is probable that the portions marked as
found in the MSS. denoted by the symbols R. and S. do
not form absolutely the whole os the common matter. The
marginal references, however, will show what parts of the text
have actually been identified and compared with R. and S.,
while it is hoped that the references to various printed texts,
though less numerous, may also be found useful. The references
to Gerbert’s Monu‘menta Veteris Litargiae A lemannicae in
particular may, in conjunction with the Appendix, enable
readers to see in what surroundings the particular prayers and
benedictions appear in the later ⁸ Gelasian ⁸ books. The
Appendix is intended to assist in this matter readers to whom
Gerbert’s work is not easily accessible, and to enable those
who have his book at hand to find their way more safely in the
labyrinth of his ‘ triple ³ Sacramentary, by showing what parts
'of that text are actually contained in the two ⁶ Gelasian’ books
which he discarded in favour os a later manuscript.

An account of the method which has been followed in the
reproduction and correction of the text of the vatican MS. will
be found in the Introduction. It may be well to say here that
corrections have been more sparingly made in the rubrics of
the manuscript than in the text os the prayers, since it often
appears that the errors of the latter are due to the mistakes
of the scribe, and are absent from the text os other books
of a date either earlier, or practically contemporary as belong-
ing to the period before the literary reforms of Charles the
Great. In the case of the rubricS, on the other hand, the
evidence of other manuscripts is scantier, and it is often on the
whole more probable that the ungrammatical form is the earliest
in which the rubric appeared.

With regard to the notes appended to the text, it should
be observed that except where the spelling os a manuscript
seems to be of any importance for the determination of the
true reading, no notice has been taken of variations in cases
where manuscripts are in substantial agreement with each other
or with the printed texts marked as agree'ing with them in
a certain reading. To have taken account of all the divergences
