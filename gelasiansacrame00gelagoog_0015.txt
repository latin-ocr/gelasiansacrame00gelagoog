between the first and second hands of the latter, would probably
have been both waerisome 3ηά useless, and would certainly have
added a great deal to the notes, which may even now seem
unduly long. Except in cases where it seemed for any reason
worth while to record the exact form, the grammatical errors of
R. are similarly passed over: but the editor has endeavoured,
as sar as possible, to take note of all those which seem to be of
any moment. In the Appendix, the same plan has been
· followed: the opening words of the prayers and prefaces are
given (spelling excepted) as they appear in the original hand of
the S. Gallen MS.

The numbers marked on the inner margin os the text refer to
the columns of the first volume of Muratori’s Litargia Romana
Vetus (Venice, 1748). They are added not only for the benefit
of those who may wish to compare the present text with that
of the earlier edition, but also for the assistance of students who
may wish to compare the readings of the ‘ Gelasian ’ books with
those of Muratori’s Gregorian text, and to employ sor that
purpose an Index to the Roman Sacramentaries of Muratori,

the preparation os the present work, 3ηά has since been published
by the Cambridge University Press.

In conclusion, the editor-desires to express his gratitude to all
those who have, in one way or in another, assisted him in his
work. His thanks are especially due to Dr. Bright, Regius
Professor of Ecclesiastical History, at whose instigation that
work was undertaken3 to Dr. Ince, Regius Professor of Divinity,
to whose kindness he owes the collation os the Vatican MS.
Reginae 3163 to the authorities os the Chapter Library of
S. Gallen, and of the Library of the Canton of Ziirich, who
most considerately sent to the Bodleian Library for his use the
S. Gallen and the Rheinau Sacramentaries3 to the Rev. F. E.
Brightman, the Rev. F. A. Overton, and Mr. C. H. Turner, for
preliminary enquiries made on his behalf as to certain manu-
scripts; to Herr Jakob Werner, for a specimen collation of
a portion of the Rheinau MS.; to Dr. Wickham Legg, sor the
loan os collatioris of the Canon Actionis-3 to the Rev. W. A.
