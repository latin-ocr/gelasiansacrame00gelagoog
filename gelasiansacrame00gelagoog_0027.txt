GERBERT’ S T RIPLE SACRAMENTARY. xix

but also in arrangement and in contents. Its division into
three books, and some other indications, seemed to show that
it was really a specimen of that older Roman Sacramentary
which writers of the ninth century alleged to have been recast
by S. Gregory, and which they connected with the name of
S. Gelasius. But there were no other ‘Gelasian ’ Sacramen⁴
tas-ies known to its editors: and although here and there the
Gregorian books which they were able to employ might throw
light on the text of the Vatican manuscript, where this was
faulty or obscure, they were of less value for such a purpose
than books more nearly approaching to the date of the Vatican
manuscript, and more nearly allied to it in structure.

Before Muratori issued his reprint‚ or Vezzosi issued his new
edition, Pierre Le Brun, the learned F rench Oratorian, had
published, under the title of Explication de la Messe ¹, his
valuable dissertations on the Liturgy. He also recognizes‚ in
the manuscript published by Tomrnasi, a representative of the

Ι Sacramentary of S. Gelasius; but he regards it as only one

specimen of a class of manuscripts of which he knew other
examples. Some of these, he tells us, he proposed to publish
in his projected Bibliotheca Liturgica3 and while he specifies
· several points of distinction between the ‘ Gelasian’ and the
‘ Gregorian’ SacramentarieS, his language suggests that his
statements as to the former class were based upon a consider-
able number of instances 2. Unhappily the Bibliotheca Liturgica
never appeared, and Le Brun’s mention of ‘ Gelasian ’ books had
not the effect of producing an enquiry as totheir place or their
contents.

In 1777 Dom Martin Gerbert, Abbot of S. Blaise in the
Black Forest, published, in the first volume of his Monumenta
Veteris Liturgiae A lemanm‘cae ⁸, a text which was in part pro-
fessedly ‘ Gelasian,’ and concerning which there could be little,
if any, doubt that it was in part actually drawn from a Sacra-
mentary of the class which was in the ninth century known as
‘ Gelasian.' At first sight, therefore, it would seem that Ger-
bert’s text must have a high value for the purpose of comparison
with the text of the Vatican manuscript. His work has certainly
