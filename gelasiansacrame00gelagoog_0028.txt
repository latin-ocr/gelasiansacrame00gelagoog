xx INTRODUCTION.

been of much service in the preparation of the present edition,
and it seems almost ungrateful to criticise the method and
execution of a scholar of the last century, to whom students of
Liturgy owe so much as we owe to Gerbert. But it must be
said that his text is one which requires to be used with caution,
that the plan which he followed in this part of his work was
chosen with an unfortunate want of judgement, and that his
mode of handling his materiaIS, and of explaining what those
materials were, is at times exceedingly confused and mis-
leading.

Of the three principal manuscripts used by Gerbert in editing,
or compiling, the text of his Sacramentary, two, the Codex
Rhenaugiensis and Codex Sangallensz's antiquior, belonged to
the class of books known as ‘ Gelasian.’ The third, a manu-
script of a peculiar character, of which he sometimes speaks by
the title Sangallensis recentior, sometimes simply by the title
sangallensis, wae, when he used it, not at S. Gallen‚ but at
Ziirich. He calls it in one passage ‘ Sangallensis olim nunc
TuricensiS, ex triplici ritu Gelasian0, GregorianO, et Ambrosiano
compositus ¹.’ To this third manuscript, of much later date

(for the Codex Rhenanagicnsis) and S. (for
the Codex Sangallensir). The third of
Gerbert's principal MSS. is sometimes
indicated in the following pages by the
symbol T. (sor Turicensrssr): but, for
reasons which will be apparent, it is not
osten mentioned. Even if it had been of
more value for the purposes of this edition
than there is any reason to suppose, it
cannot now be traced. Its presence at
Ziirich is most probably to be explained
by supposing that it was one of the
manuscripts which seu to the share of
the town of Ziirich, and were removed to
its Town Library, when the Library of
S. Gallen was plundered in the religious
war of 1712 by the forces of Ziirich and
Bern, and that it was not among those
which were returned to S. Gallen a few
years later. Both in a Ziirich list of
manuscripts brought from S. Gallen,
drawn up in 1713, and in a S. Gallen

volume described as Collectae Missales:
the S. Gallen list adds the further de-
scription ⁴ seu Missae Gregorianne et
Ambrosianae,’ a phrase which seems to
point to a compound Sacramentary, and
may not impossibly be a description of
the Sacramentary which Gerbert, later in
the eighteenth century, found at Ziirich.
(Weidmann, Gesclt. der Biblabthek von
S. Gallm, pp. 435, 440.) In the Cata-
logue of the S. Gallen MSS. edited by
G. Scherrer (Helle, 1875), in the notice of
the S. Gallen MS. 348, reference is made
to Gerbert's work, and the triple Sacra-
mentary used by him is described as
⁶ jetzt Ziircher codex C. 389! It does
not appear whence Scherrer derived this
information. But the manuscript now
bearing the mark C. 389 in the Town
Library of Ziirich is not a Sacramentary,
but a collection of miscellaneous frag-
mentS. Curionsly enough, however, it
contains the following extract from a
letter, written in 1764 by Gerbert to the
