xxii INTRODUCTION.
as to leave no doubt that both had been copied from the same
source, though S. contained some missae for festivals and some
other matter which had been added in the interval between the
dates at which the two had been written. It was true, he
thought, that the latter part of R. contained a good deal which
was not to be found in S.: but so far as the first part, con-
taining the services for the yearly round of Sundays and
festivals, was concerned, S. seemed to him to contain practically
everything that was to be found in R., with valuable additions.
As between these tw0, therefore, he would have given the
preference to S. as an authority, even if it had not possessed
what he regarded as an advantage of special importance.
Originally, he sayS, R. and S. had agreed ‘ad apicem usque . . .
in corrupto etiam dicendi scribendique genere, erroribus gram-
maticalibus ac sphalmatis aevo Merovingico propriis ¹.’ But
the original text of S. had been revised and corrected by a later
hand, which had ‘ restored the true sense ’ by emending the
errors of the original scribe: and these improvements in the
text were to be found also in T., since the compiler of this
manuscript had followed the corrected text of S. Thus, in
Gerbert's view, while S. contained, in its round of services, all,
or nearly all, that was to be found in the parallel portion of R„
T. also contained the whole, or nearly the whole, of what was to
be* found in S., in a corrected and improved form, and with
further additions·

He accordingly determined to reproduce the text of T., dis-
tinguishing by special type those parts of the ‘ triple text ’
which were to be found in S., and marking by brackets those
portions which, though contained in S., were not to be found
in R. Where T. was defective, he used one or other of the
two older manuscripts as the basis of his text, and he also
reproduced from R. a good deal of matter not contained in S.
or T., while he occasionally added, in his footnotes to the text,
some particulars as to the readings or arrangement of the two
older manuscripts. Unfortunately, in carrying out his plan, he

faulty thau that of S., and its spelling
much more variable and incon-rect. As

¹ An examination of the two MSS. does
not bear out Gerbert’s statement on this

point. The text of the two agreeS, in the
common matter, very closely, but they do
not by any means exactly accord with one
another in the matters of grammar and
spelling. The grammar of R. is more

to the nature and extent of the agreement
which Gerbert alleges to exist between
them in respect of the matter contained
in the two Sacramenuuies, more will be
said at a later stage.
