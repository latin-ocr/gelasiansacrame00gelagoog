GERBERT'S T RJPLE SACRAMENTARY. xxiii
was not always careful in the employment of his marks of
differentiation. Some entire missae and many portions of
missae which are contained in S·- are not distinguished by the
type which ought to mark the matter found in the older books,
while a large number of missae which are absent from R. appear
in his text without the brackets which ought to have indicated
their absence from that manuscript ¹.

But besides this defect of accuracy in following out the plan
he had laid down for himself (a defect which seriously diminishes
the value of the information conveyed by his method) Gerbert’s
way ⁴of regarding his materials had another unfortunate result.
As he was inclined to minimise the differences of text between
R. and S., he was also inclined to underrate‚ or to misunder-
stand, the importance of the changes introduced into the latter
manuscript by the hand of the corrector. These changes were,
in many cases, much more than mere corrections of mistakes
in grammar or variations in spelling. The effect, if not the
purpose, of the corrector’s work has generally been the altera-
tion of the original text into closer agreement with the text of
the later Sacramentaries of the type known as ‘ Gregorian.’
Hence it comes to pass that the ‘ Gelasian ’ portions of the
⁸ triple text ' of Τ. (and therefore of Gerbert’s printed text) do
not represent the original text of the ‘ Gelasian ’ books, but
a revision of that text, apparently based upon the text of the
Sacramentaries of the ‘ Gregorian ' type ²! The evidence for
this statement will be found in the notes of the present volume,
where it will again and again appear that the text of R. and the
original text of S. are in agreement with the readings of the
Vatican manuscript, while the readings of the later hand of S.,
followed by Gerbert’s printed text, are in agreement with the

¹ Gerbert himself apologizet, ln his
prefaoe, for the omission, in two specified
enses, of these distinguishing brackets:
but the inmnoes of such omission are
far more numerous. As a matter of fact
he has failed to mark in this way more
than sixty entire minae, and a large
number of Collects and Prefaces. It is
quite impossible to gather from his text
the real state of the case as to the'amonnt
of matter common to R. and S.

² This does not of course apply to the
porticus of Gerbert's text where R. has

been employed as his authority. In these
portions he reproduces the readings of the
original text, not literally, but with sub-
stantinl aocuraey for the most part. He
has, however, occasionally failed to read
the manuscript correctly, or to notice the
existence of a gap occasioned by the loss
of a leaf, and has thus perpetrated one
or two amazing blunders. In anything
which he extraets directly from S., he
appears ns a rule to follow the readings
of the second hand. ·
