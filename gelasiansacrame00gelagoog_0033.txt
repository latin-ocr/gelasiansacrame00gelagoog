THE VA TJCAN ΜΞ. (ν.) «xxv- ,

described by M. Leopold Delisle ¹, and from his descriptions the
following brief account of its external features is drawn. The
manuscript contains 245 leaves, measuring 263 by 164 milli-
metres (or about 10} by δὲ inches), and is written throughout
in uncial characters with the exception of the Latin versions of
the bilingual texts of the Lord's Prayer² and the Creed ³.

The Greek versions are written in Roman uncials, while the
Latin versions, between the lines of the Greek, are in a minuscule
hand of a Lombardic type. The contents of the manuscript are
divided into numbered sections, the headings os which are
written in red and green. The last page of each gathering of
the manuscript bears a signature in Roman numerals: and in
these signatureS‚ as in the numeration of the sections of the
text, the number six is occasionally denoted by the Episemou.
Each of the three books into which the Sacramentary is divided·
is preceded by an ornamental design covering the verso of
a leaf the recto of which is left blank. The design in each case
is that of an arch enclosing a cross having the letters Alpha and
Omega dependent from its arms 4. The titles prefixed to the
three books are as follows :—- '

(i) ‘In nomine Domini Ihesu Salvatoris. Incipit liber Sa-
cramentorum Romanae aecclesiae ordinis anni circuli.’

(ii) ‘ Incipit liber secundus Oraciones et praeces de nataliciis
sanctorum? .

(iii) ‘ Incipit liber tercius. Oraciones et praeces cum canone
per dominicis diebus!

The third book is closed with the words ‘Explicit liber Sacra-
mentorum. Deo gracias?

On palaeographical groundS, M. Delisle assigns the manu-
script to the seventh, or the early part os the eighth, century.
The fact that it was written sor some church in the Frankish
kingdom is shown not only by the names of saints mentioned in
the Canon, but also by the mention of the ‘Imperium Fran-
corum ’ in the Good F riday prayers. The Sacramentary itself
