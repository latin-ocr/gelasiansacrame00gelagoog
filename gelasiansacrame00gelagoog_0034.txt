is complete, but the first part of a list of its contentS, prefixed
to the whole, has been lost. The remains of this list, with the
bilingual text of the Lord’s Prayer, occupy the first and second
leaveS.

When we pass from considering the outward appearance of
the book to the examination of its contents, we find that the
matter contained in its three divisione does not in any one case
exactly coi-respond with the title. The first book contains
several sections, relating to Episcopal functions, which would in
later timeo have formed part of the ‘ Pontifical,’ and which do
not, strictly speaking, fall under the description of the contenta
of the book as ‘ ordinis anni circuli! These portions do not
stand together, but while some of them are to be found at the
end os the book, others are fitted into the series of minae and
prayers for the course of the Church year from Christmas to
Pentecost, which occupies the first half of the book. This
method is also followed with regard to certain offices and forms
which would in later times have been included in the Missal,
but would also have found their place in the ‘ Manual ⁹ or
‘ Rituale.’ Thus the forms for the Ordination of Deacons and
Priests are placed after the Orationes et preces in xii lectiones
mense primo which follow the missae for the first week in
Lent, while the other forms os Ordination stand near the end of
the book. The prayers super Poe-nitentes are, not unnaturally,
placed at the beginning of Lent, and the forms for the public
reconciliation of the PenitentS, and for the hallowing of the
Oils and Chrism, find their place in the section relating to the
Thursday in Coena Domini. It may be regarded as a natural
arrangement that the forms relating to the preparation of the
Catechumens should be intercalated with the series of Lent
missae, and that those relating to the consecratio Fontis and to
Baptism and Confirmation should stand in the section relating
to Easter Even. But it is not at first sight clear why other
forms relating to Penitents should be joined with those belonging
to the order of Maundy Thursday, and perhaps still less clear
why the forms relating to the Baptism of the Sick should be
placed between the prayers of Ascensiontide and those of Pen-
tecost. To this point reference will be made again, in treating
of the arrangement of the Rheinau Sacramentary, which seems
to throw some light on the structure of the first book of the
Vatican manuscript. Another instance of inserted matter is
