suggest a doubt whether the method of division which we find in
the Vatican manuscript was adopted in the Roman Sacramen-
tary used by its compilet. It seems possible that the severance
of the Advent missae from the series contained in the first book
may have been due to a division, awkwardly carried out, of the
contents of a Sacramentary which, like the Rheinau and
S. Gallen manuscripts, had the Proprium de Tempore and the
Proprium Sanctorum placed together in a single series, and
which, like the S. Gallen manuscript ¹, described that series as
⁸ ordinis anni circuli,' or ‘ [per] anni circulum.'

With regard to the contents of the Proprium Sanctorum we
may here notice that almost every festival included in this por-
tion of the Vatican manuscript finds a place also in the S. Gallen
Sacramentary, and that in a very large proportion os cases the
missa assigned to a festival in the S. Gallen book agreeS‚ in
whole or in part, with that which belongs to the same festival in
the Vatican manuscript. The Proprium Sanctorum of the
Rheinau manuscript is much more limited in extent, but this
also contains a good deal in common with this portion of the
Vatican manuscript. The presence of missae for the four
festivals of the Blessed Virgin seems to point to a date later than
the beginning of the seventh century sor the source from which
they were taken, if this was a Roman Sacramenta‘ry² : and the
missa for the festival of the Exaltation of the Cross probably
dates from some time after 628.

The third book begins with a series of missae sor Sundays, the
contents of which (except sor the fact that none of the missae
contains a proper Preface) correspond almost exactly with
a portion of the series of missae assigned in the Rheinau and
S. Gallen books to the Sundays between Pentecost and Advent.
Then follows the Canon Actionis, with two serieS‚ one of Post·-
communionS, the other of benedictions super Populum. N ext
come several missae for ordinary days; and the remainder of
the book is occupied by a collection of missae and prayers for
special purposeS, including forms relating to Marriage‚ and to the'
Burial of the Dead. The first part of this book (the series of
Sunday missae) is found, as has been said, in the Rheinau an'd
