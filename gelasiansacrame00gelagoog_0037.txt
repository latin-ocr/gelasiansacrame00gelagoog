THE VA Tse-AN Ms: (V.) xxix

S. Gallen books: these also contain a similar set of missae for
ordinary days, with the Canon Actionis and appended series of
Postcommunions and Benedictions. But with the last of these
the S. Gallen book now ends, so that that Sacramentary has
nothing corresponding to the latter part of the third book. The
Rheinau Sacramentary, on the other hand, contains a similar
series of special missae and occasional prayerS, having much in
common with the parallel portion of the Vatican manuscript.

In the third book, once more, we find some indications that
the Roman Sacramentary used by the compilet was probably
later than the beginning of the seventh century. In the Canon
Actionis the clause Diesque nostros, said to have been added by
S. Gregory, is present, and the name of S. Gregory is mentioned

among those of the saints ¹. But we may notice on the other
hand, that many of the special missae in the latter portion of

the book, which have clauses for insertion in the Canon, take no
notice of the clause Diesque nostros, but pass directly from the
end of the Hanc igitur to the Quam oblationem. This may
indicate for these sections an origin earlier than the time of
S. Gregory’s pontificate : but the inference is not a certain
one.

The spelling and· grammar of the manuscript are, as might be
expected in a manuscript of the Merovingian period, exceed-
ingly capricious and irregular. The method which has been
adopted in reproducing its text is one which is certainly open
to some objections, but it appeared, aster careful consideration, to
be on the whole the most satisfactory sor practical uses.

From one point of view it would no doubt have been desirable
to aim at an exact literal reproduction of the text of the manu-
script, with all its errors. But the conditions under which the
preparation of this edition has been carried on rendered this
course practically impossible, since it would have required, not
only the making os an exact transcript, but als0, if the work
were to be done with the minute care which such a method
would demand, the careful correction of the proof-sheets by
comparison with the manuscript itself. It would have required
