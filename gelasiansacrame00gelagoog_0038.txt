variations of spelling in the kindred manuscripts ζ and the result
of this would have been a very large addition to the bulk of the
notes appended to the text, and therefore to the size of the
volume. Another possible method would have been to adopt?
an arbitrary standard of spelling based on what might be called
the normal spelling of the manuscript: but this method would
not have had the advantage of an exact reproduction of the
text, while it would have been found impossible, in some caseS,
to say what the normal spelling os the scribe really is. The
best course therefore seemed to be that of following the ex-
ample os the former editors, in adopting a modern standard of
spelling, and of carefully noting the readings of the manu-
script, where there seemed to be any doubt as to a particular

word or phrase, arising from the possibility os rendering a mis-
spelt word in more ways than one. For this purpose, a careful

collation of the manuscript seemed to be all that was neces-
sary, and upon such a collation the present text is based ¹.

But a further question presented itself, the question of re-
jecting or retaining obviously ungrammatical readings ε and this
was a point on which it was more difficult to arrive at a decision.
It has seemed best, on the whole, to set aside those readings
which are probably due to the errors of the scribe. SometimeS,
as when an ablative and an accusative are both made to depend
upon the same verb, or when a reading may be treated either as
an ungrammatical construction, or as a simple error of spelling,
these corrections have been made sub silentio. But in cases
where an ungrammatical reading is set aside, either on the
evidence of the manuscript itself, which elsewhere gives the
phrase in a form grammatically correct, or on the evidence os
other textS, the rejected reading, and the evidence in favour of
the more grammatical form, are given in the notes. lt has
seemed reasonable to use, as the means of such correctionS, not
only the earlier text of the Leonine Sacramentary, and the
practically contemporary texts of the Gallican bookS, but also
the later texts of the Rheinau and S. Gallen manuscript3‚ and of
