THE VATJCAN MS. (ν.) xxxi

documents reproduced by Martene, since these later textS‚
though later, still serve to show that the grammatically correct
form was current before the literary reforms of Charles the
Great, or in manuscripts which contain a sufficient amount of
error to make it clear that their texts owed little or nothing
of their correctness to these reforms. Where no such evidence
for the early existence os a grammatical reading of a passage
is to be found, or where the kindred manuscripts of Rheinau
and S. Gallen clearly support the ungrammatical reading, that
reading has been retained in the text, and its character, in
most caseS, indicated by the appended noteS.

The most notable grammatical errors of the manuscript are
the following 2-—

(a) The abuse‘ of cases. The ablative and accusative cases
are frequently interchanged: in some instances the apparent
misuse of the ablative may be due to the accidental omission of
a superscribed m: but this theory· would not account for the
whole of the instances. In one or two places the accusative
· seems to be used for the nominative1: but these cases may be
due to the loss of some word in the text.

(b) The use of the imperative mood for the subjunctive,
following ut. This may perhaps, at least in the majority of
instanceS, be explained by supposing that ut is a clerical error
for et: but the fact that the verb, rather than the conjunction,
has been altered in the later recension of the text, must be .
taken into account in estimating the character of the error.

(c) The present participle is occasionally used (probably with
a suppression of the verb substantive) in an imperative sense ².

The interchange of certain letterS, which is a marked feature
of the spelling of the manuscript, is no doubt due in many cases
to similarity of soundS. The following are the chief cases os
substitution or variation ⁸ :—

a is used for ae, e, in some instances for i (e.g. turabulis =
thuribulis).

ae (or its equivalent ς) is used for a, e, oe, i.
