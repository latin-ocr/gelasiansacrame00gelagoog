THE RHEINAU MS. (R.) xxxiii

tents: but except as regards the latter part, it may be said that
Gerbert fails to give any accurate information as to its text or
arrangement. ·

The volume now contains 189 leaves of parchment, the size of
the leaves being about 1 1 ᾖ by 6} inches. The leaves have been
numbered by pages, beginning with the verso of the first leaf.
The numeration has been made rather carelessly3 only one
side os each leaf has been numbered3 the numbering is not
consecutive in some cases where nothing is wanting in the
manuscript13 one leaf bears the same number as that which
precedes it²; and there are three unnumbered leaves ³. The
binding is not ancient.

An examination of the gatherings shows that, besides being
defective at the end, the volume haS, at some time anterior to
the numbering of the pages, lost several leaves· It now con-
tains twenty-three gatherings. each of which appears to have
’ consisted of eight leaves. Only one of these is now signed‚ the
old numbering having probably been cut off in the case of the
· others. The collation may be given summarily as followS, the

gatherings being indicated by letters 2—-
A⁸ 13⁸ (5, 7, 8 lost) C⁸ D⁸ (1, 5, 8 lost) Ε8 (1 lost) F⁸ G⁸ H⁸ (4,

 

5 lost) 1⁸ K⁸ L⁸(510st) M⁸ N⁸ 0⁸ Ρ8 9⁸ R⁸ s⁸ T⁸ (4. 510st) νε Ι

X⁸ Y⁸ Ζ8 (1, 7, 8 lost).

The only one with a signature is the gathering V, which
is marked xvi. This is the sixteenth gathering of the Sacra-
mentary proper, which begins with the fifth gathering of the
volume, at the page marked 54. Hence it may be inserted that
the first four gatherings of the present book did not originally
form part of the same volume with the Sacramentary. They
are apparently of about the same date with the Sacramentary
itself, with the exception of the last two leaveS, which are in
a rather later hand. The contents of these preliminary leaves
are as follows :—

(ῐ) Portions of a Gradual ⁴, beginning on p. 1, and occupying
thirteen leaves·

(2) Portions of a Penitential, beginning on p. 28, and occupy-
ing eleven leaveS.

67, 78, 105, 226, 227. · the numbers 138, 318, 326. “
