Gerbert (Mon. Vet. Lit. Alem. vol. i. p. 282), where the Secret
takes the form of a ‘ bidding·prayer ' and begins with the words
‘Auditis nominibus offerentium: which clearly point to a
previous recitation of the names-

The contents of the first portion of the manuscript show, as
has been already said, a close resemblance to those of the
S. Gallen Sacramentary. The missae for saints’-days, however,
are sar less numerous in the Rheinau than in the S. Gallen, and
the orders sor the consecration of the Chrism and for the public
reconciliation of the Penitents on Maundy Thursday are absent
from the Rheinau manuscript. The inference to be drawn from
the non-appearance of these sections seems to be that the
manuscript was written sor the use of a priest, and not for that
of a bishop; and this view concerning it will be found to explain
some points with regard to the second part of its contents. The
headings of the missae of the first portion contain mention of
the Roman ‘ stations ’ for the days of Lcnt‚ the Ember days, and
for certain festivaIS, a fact which testifies to the Roman origin of
the Sacramentary ¹. The presence of missae for the Thursdays
in Lent shows that this part of its text is of a date as late as
the time of Gregory II (715—31).

The second part of the Sacramentary is almost 311 included
by Gerbert in his Sacramentary, but he does not follow the
order in which the parts stand in the manuscript. This will be
seen, it is hoped‚ more clearly in the Appendix to the present
volume. The second part begins after the series of Post-
communions and Benedictions which follow the Canon Actionis,
and is preceded by the words ‘ Expliciunt benedictiones anni
circuli est numerus lxxii. Incipit Liber secundus de extrema
parte.’ The ‘ benedictiones anni circuli ' here referred to cannot
be the Benedictions which stand immediately before the words:
for these are not by any means so numerous· It seems most
likely that the words were copied by the scribe from a manu-
script in which they stood at the close of 3 series of Episcopal
Benedictions such as were used in Gaul, and might be included
in a Sacramentary intended for use by a bishop‚ but would
naturally be omitted in a book intended for a priest, by whom
