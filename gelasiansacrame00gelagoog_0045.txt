THE RHEJNAU MS: (R.) xxxvii

these Benedictions would not be given. The peculiar phrase
‘Incipit Liber secundus de extrema parte' may be similarly
accounted for. If the ‘ Liber secundus' of the Sacramentary
before the scribe contained, as it very likely would contain‚
such forms as would, at a later time, have been included in a
‘ Pontifical,’ and these forms stood at the beginning os the ‘ Liber
secundus'l, the portion which remained, aster their omission,
would naturally enough be described as ‘ de extrema parte! In
this case, the first portion os the ‘ Liber secundus’ probably
included the forms of Ordination, the ‘ Consecratio Virginum‚'
the forms for Dedication of Churches, and perhaps also the order
sor the Reconciliation of the PenitentS, and such forms for the
Reconciliation of Heretics as we find in sections lxxxv-lxxxvii
of the first book of the Vatican manuscript.

The ‘ Liber secunduS,' as we have it here, contains none os
these. It begins with a selection of Collects for Mattius, Vespers,
and other Hours. Next comes the Ordo Baptzlrterii, including
not only the actual Baptismal riteS, with the form for hallowing
the font, but also the missae for the ‘ Scrutinies? the exorcisms
to be said over the catechumenS, and the forms. relating to the
Baptism of the Sick, and to the admission of a heathen to the
status of a catechumen. These correspond very closely with the
various sections of the Vatican manuscript which provide for the
same purposes; but they do not include the forms for the
Expositio Evangeliorum, the Praefatio Symboli, or the Praefatio
Orationis Dominicae. Nor do they include the form of Con·
firmation which in the Vatican manuscript stands at the end of
the Baptismal order: the reason for this omission is probably
the same which has dictated the omission of the missa Chrismalis.
But it is to be observed that in the Rheinau Sacramentary the
Ordo Baptzkterii forms one whole. In the Vatican manuscript,
the different parts of it are separated; the missae for the
‘ Scrutinies' are placed among the Lent missae, and assigned to

² It may be remerked that if a series
of Episcopel Benedictions for use at MasS,
such as is here supposed to be referred to
in the phrase ‘ benedictiones anni circuli '
were placed (as it conveniently might be
placed) just aster the Canon Actionis and
the accompanying series of Postcom-
muniens and Orationes super Populum,
it would be all the more natural that the

offices for the bishop's nse should stand

. at the beginning of the ⁴ Liber secundus ’τ

while, if the ⁴ Pontifieal ' formed the first
part of the Liber secundus of a Roman
Sacramentum, into which these Gallican
benedictions were inserted, the latter would

be most conveniently plaoed just before
the Pontifical.
