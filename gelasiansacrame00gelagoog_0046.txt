xxxviii INTROD UCYION.

the third, fourth, and fifth Sundays of Lent¹: the hallowing of
the font and the actual order of Baptism are placed among the
sections relating to Easter, while the rubric, which in the Rheinau
manuscript follows the order of Baptism, and directs that the
order at Pentecost is to be the same as at Easter, is in the
Vatican manuscript placed after the missa for the Sunday before
Pentecost, and has carried along with it into this place the forms
for the Baptism of the Sick, which in the Rheinau Sacramentary
also follow the rubric, but there form a natural appendix to the
first part of the Ordo Baptisterii. The result of this arrangement
in the Vatican manuscript is the placing of these forms in a
position where there is no obvious roeson for their presence, and
where they interrupt the regular order of the Sacramentary.
The inference to be drawn from these facts seems perfectly
clear. The compilet of the Vatican manuscript had before him
an Ordo Raptis-terii agreeing closely with that contained in the
‘ Liber secundus ’ of the Rheinau manuscript, though perhaps
including certain things which are not to be found in the
Rheinau book ². But instead of transcribing it as a continuous
whole, he divided it, intending to graft the several portions of
it into the Sacramentary at convenient points : and the process
of grafting has been carried out, in one instance, so awkwardly
as to leave a plain indication of what has taken place. A similar
process seems to have been attempted with the forms of Ordi-
nation. The sections of the Vatican manuscript which contain
the forms for ordaining Deacons and Priests have been placed
at what seemed to be a convenient point, after the missae for
the first of the Ember seasonS, near the beginning of the first
book, while the forms of admission to the Minor OrderS, and
that for the Consecration of Bishops stand near the end of the
same book, in conjunction with other parts of what, for con-
venience sake, may be called the Pontifical. And in this case
again we have an indication that what is now divided formed,

Both follow a common form, while in The forms for the exposition of the
