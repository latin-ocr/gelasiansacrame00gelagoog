THE RHEJNA U MS. (R.) xxxix

in the manuscript used by the compilet, a consecutive whole.
The forms relating to the Consecration of Churches are followed
by the sections relating to the Minor Orders: these are followed
by missae for the anniversaries of the ordination of the cele-
brant as Deacon and as Priest. Next come the prayers for the
Consecration of BishopS‚ which are followed by anniversary
missae3 and these are succeeded by the Consecratio sacrae
virginis, which again is followed by a series of missae sor the
anniversary of the profession. It seems that there can be little
doubt that the Ordination forms which now stand at the
beginning of the book have been transferred to a new place
by the compiler, who has failed to transfer along with them
the anniversary missae which were annexed to them in their
original position. Thus we may see that the forms of Ordi-
nation, and the form for the benediction of nuns were probably,
in the manuscript which he used, all placed together ¹. Such
a collection would include the greater part of the matter which,
as has been suggested above, the scribe os the Rheinau MS.
’ discarded from the ‘Liber secundu5,’ as not required for the
purpose which his book was intended to serve.

Returning to the actual contents of the Rheinau MS. we
find that it contains, after the Ordo Baptisterii, a collection
of mtlvsae, benedictionS, and prayers for special purposes, corre-
sponding in general character, and sometimes closely agreeing
in arrangement and in text, with the similar collection in the
third book of the Vatican MS. We find also the form sor
the reconciliation of a penitent at the point of death, the Com-
mendatio Animae, and the order sor the Burial of the Dead
(in somewhat more minute detail than the parallel portion of
the Vatican MS.); and these are followed, as in the Vatican
MS„ by a collection of Missae pro defunctis. There are also
some forms for the exorcism of ‘ possessed ’ persons, which in
part agree with the parallel portion of the Vatican MS. With
these the Sacramentary ends ; for the Breviarium Apostolorum ²

¹ The forms of admission to the Minor
Οῐᾶετε, and the section (or the greater
part of the section) containing canonical
regulations on the subject of ordination,
are probably of Gallionn origin, and de·
rived from another source. (See Duchesne,
Origines du Culte C Iarltien, pp. 338, 350.)
From the same Gallim source, probably,

were drawn the forms which appear in the
Vatican manuscript annexed to the Roman
forms for the ordination of Deacons and
Priests (pp. 24, 28 of the present volume),
and perhaps that for the Dedicntion of a
Church (pp. 133-6). See Duchesne, Or.
