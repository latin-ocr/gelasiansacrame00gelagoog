and the fragment of the Martyrologium already mentioned are
not, strictly speaking, parts of the Sacramentary itself, but are
rather of the nature of an Appendix.

It may be noted that in the Rheinau MS. as in the Vatican
MS. the name ‘ Secreta ' is used as the heading of the prayer
which in the S. Gallen MS. has the title of ‘ Super oblata ἐ
while some of the Prefaces are marked by the heading ‘ Con-
testatio ’ or ‘ Contestatass

III. The S. Gallen MS. 348 [S.] is also described by
M. Delisle (Me'moire sur d ’ancz‘e’ns Sacramentaires, pp. 84-6). It
is a small volume, bound in stamped white sheepskin or pigskin

· on oak boardS, with leather clasp5, and now contains 388

numbered pageS, including eight pages of paper at the begin-
ning¹ and six at the end of the volume. The paper and the
binding are both of the same period (c. 1400), and are perhaps
only a little earlier than the inscription ‘ Collectarium vetustum'
upon the binding.

The parchment leaves, now number-ing 184 (pp. 9-376), are
arranged in eighteen gatheringS‚ of which the first two appear
to be a later addition to the original volume. These two
gatherings are signed at the end with the marks 1 and 11,
those which next follow being marked at the beginning as 111
and 1111, but bearing also at the end their original SIgnatures
Ι and 11. The fifth gathering, and those which follow it, with
the exception of the last ², are signed at the end with letterS,
beginning with C. The collation, summarily stated, is as
follows 2-—

1⁶ 11⁴² I II8 (ΣΙ)ιο Ε12 F¹⁰ GH1² (H7 now lost) 1¹⁰ Κ12 L¹⁰ Μ14
NOPQ¹² (Q¹² now lost).

The original Sacramentary begins on p. 32 (i. e. on the verso
of the second leaf of gathering Ι), with an illuminated title,
filling the whole page: ‘ In nomine sancte Trinitatis. Incipit
liber sacramentorum anni circulum Romane ecclesie.’ The
recto of the leaf is blank, and the first leaf of the gathering was
probably also left blank by the original scribe. The pages

is printed by Gerbert (Mon. Vct. Lis. with his ‘ Sangallensis antiquior? The

Alem. vol. i. p. 453). fourth, fifth, and sixth pages are blank,

The third contains a note with the signa· ² The last leaf of this gathering, which

ture of ‘Martin Gerbert Abbas S. Blasii: probably bore the signature Q, is now
which shows that the MS. is identical lost.
