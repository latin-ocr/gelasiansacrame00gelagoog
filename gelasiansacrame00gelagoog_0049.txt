THE s, GA LLEN MS. (S.) xli

srom 9 to 30 inclusive contain additional matter, written by
different banda, at different times. The earliest portions are
apparently but little later than the body of the MS. while the
latest may belong to the early years of the tenth century ¹.
The Sacramentary itself is written in a hand which may be
best described as of a ‘ modified Lombardic’ type, and which
seems to belong to the beginning of the ninth or the end os the
eighth century ²· Traces of Lombardic writing appear also
throughout the later additions on pp. 9—30, though they are
less strongly marked than those which are to be found in the
Sacramentary itself. In the ornamentation of the initial lettere,
and in the decorative use of red dotS, there may perhaps be
found some indication of Irish influence.

The spelling of the MS. presents few peculiarities: the use of
e for i is rather frequent, and there are occasional instances of
the use of ο for u. But both in spelling and in grammar the
manuscript shows a much smaller proportion of errors than the
Rheinau codex. The errors which it does contain have been
'generally corrected, and further emendations of the work of
the original scribe have been made, by a second hand, probably

¹ The eontents of these added leaves
may be briefly noted :—

P. 9 (mutilated) contains 'prayers for
use at the time of the Oblation of the
Eucharistic elementa

Pp. 10-12, 17—18 contain missae and
prayers for the Festival of S. Gall, and
its vigil and Octave. These are inter-
rupted by the insertion of other matter
on pp. 13-16 (see below).

Pp. 18-21 contain missae for All Saints
Day and for its vigil. [These portions
are written in a hand probably of the
latter part of the ninth century]

Pp. 13-16‚ which now form the middle
sheet of the gathering‚ contain a Missa
qnam sacerdos pro semettpso debet canere:
the prayers of this missa are in a hand of
about the year 900, the Epistle and Gospel
being added at the end, in a haud probably
of the early part of the tenth century.

Pp. 22-3 contain a ‘Horologium' or
table showing the length of a shadow at
certain hom os the day in each mouth os
the year.

Pp. 24-8 contain missae with the fol-

lowing headings :—-(a) Missa S. Mariae.
(b) Alia Missa in Sanctorum [sie]. (e)
Item alia Mosa. (d) Missa de Trinitate.
(e) Item Missa pro quemcunque [sic]
cupis. (f ) Mssa pro pcccatis (incom-
plete).

Pp. 29-30 are in a hand different from
that of the preceding pages. They contain
the end of a missa for the vigil of the
Assumption, and a missa for the F estival.
[There is clearly a break between the
contents of p. 28 and those of p. ²9 (i. e.
between the gatherings 11 and 1): but
the whole of the eontents of pp. 22—30
are probably of about the same date,
most likely before 830]

² This phrase is horrowed from Dr.
Maunde Thompson (Hancffiook off Greek
and Latin palaeography, p. 218), who
points out that the most distinctly Lom-
bardic character attaches only to certain
letters in the MS. A page of the MS.
has been reproduoed in facsimile in the
collection of the Palaeographical Society.
[Plate 185 (or vol. iii. no. 9).] Another
appears in the present volume.
