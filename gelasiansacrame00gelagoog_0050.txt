of the ninth century. Sometimes the original writIng has been
altogether erased, and in some other cases it is not quite clear
what the reading of the first hand has been: but in the great
majority of instances the original reading can be quite clearly
made out. In citing the readings of the MS. in the notes to the
present volume, the original text is indicated by the symbol 5ι
(a query being added where the reading seems probable, but not
absolutely certain) and the emended text by the symbol 8².
Speaking generally, it may be said that in the matter common
to this MS„ the Vatican MS„ and Gerbert's text, the readings of
5¹ are in agreement with the Vatican MS. and those of 82 with
Gerbert’s text.. But the portions of the MS. where the cor-
rector has used the greatest freedom are the Prefaces, the
greater number os which are not contained in the Vatican MS.
In these portions also, the readings os S² generally agree with
those of Gerbert's text.

A further point to be noted with regard to the MS. is the
appearance in many places of notes, most of which may be
assigned to the tenth century, which have apparently been
intended, as M. Delisle remarks, for the guidance of a scribe
who was engaged in writing a Sacramentary, using the MS.
as his model, but making some variatione from its order, and
incorporating matter from other sources. It may be observed
that in its divergences from the text of the S. Gallen MS„ as
corrected, the ‘ Gelasian ⁹ text of Gerbert's triple Sacramentary
almost always follows these marginal directions: and this fact
strongly supports Gerbert's view that the S. Gallen MS. was
that employed by the scribe of his triple Sacramentary (‘ San-
gallensis olim, nunc Turicensis') sor the ‘ Gelasian ' part os his
compilation.

It seems most likely that the manuscript, though it had very
possibly passed into the possession of the monastery of S. Gallen
before the time when Gerbert’s triple Sacramentary was written,
was not written in that house. It is most improbable that it
would in that case have contained no missa for the Festival of
S. Gall: and there is no such missa in the Sacramentary itself,
though the deficiency is, as we have seen, supplied by some os
the leaves added at a later time. Among the notes already
mentioned is one at the point (p. 307) where the Festival would
sall, ‘ Hic scribe de Sco. Gallo’: and in Gerbert’s text we find
the services for the Vigil and Festival inserted.
