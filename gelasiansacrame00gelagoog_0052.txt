exact date of Remedius’ episcopate is not known. The dates
commonly assigned for his accession (800) and for his death
(820) do not seem to rest on any very good authority. It is
certain that he was Bishop in the year 800, since Alcuin men-
tions him as such in a letter of that year, addressed to Anno os
Salzburg: and it is not impossible that he may have become
Bishop before that year. On the other hand, in view of the
fact that he seems to have been in high favour at the court of
CharleS, it has been supposed that his death had already taken
place before the change in the administration of the province in
806, a change for which the death os an active and capable
‘ Rector ' would possibly give occasion ¹.

1f this view as to the date of Remedius’ death is correct, the
date of our manuscript cannot be later than 806: and the same
consequence will follow if we adopt the view that the mention
of his name in the manuscript is due to his possession of a tem-
poral dignity which came to an end in that year. On the other
hand, it does not seem that the evidence as to the date os his
accession to the see of Chur, and to the temporal dignity
annexed to that see, necessarily points to the year 800 as the
earliest possible date. It is perhaps hardly safe to lay much
stress on such phrases as ‘ pro Christianissimis imperatoribus
nostris²' as an indication of date. But the presence of this
phrase in the manuscript is perhaps most easily accounted for
if we suppose that it was written before the coronation of Charles
the Great, and that the phrase is a survival, having reference to
the Eastern imperial house. 1f the words are to be taken
strictly ³, and interpreted of the new Western dynasty‚ they would
point to a date as late as 8134. But on the whole it may be
said that whether the true date of the manuscript is to be found
in the eighth or in the ninth century, it is probably within
a short distance of the year 800, while the evidence seems to
point to the district of Rhaetia as the place where it was written.

That district was, as we have said, but little affected by
