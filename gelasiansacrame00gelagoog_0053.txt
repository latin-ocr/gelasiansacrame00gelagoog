THE s, GALLEN MS. (S.) xlv

Teutonic influence3 and we find in the contents of the Sacra-
mentary but few traces of ‘ Gallican ³ usage, and none (except
for the mention of RemediuS‚ already referred to) of the recog-
nition of any other temporal power than the Roman.. There is
no mention of the ‘ regnum Francorum ’ such as we find in the
Vatican and Rheinau MSS. Apart from the evidence of the
Proprium Sanctorum the most notable point in which Gallican
influence may be discerned is the mention of S. Hilary and
S. Martin in the ‘Communicantes’ clause of the Canon. If
M. Duchesne's suggestion as to the origin of the two forms
which appear at the end of the Missa Chris-maltis· in the Vatican
MS.1 is correct, we must reckon their appearance in the S. Gal-
len MS. as a sign of possible Gallican influence. The form
os blessing the Paschal candle is the same as that which appears
in the Gallican bookS, but it is probable that this form, as well
as the usage of the benediction, had already found its way into
Italy before the end of the eighth century. The form for bless-
ing the lamb at the close of the Canon in the Missa in Nocte
Sancta (see Gerb. p. 90) illustrates a custom which, though
probably not general, was apparently sufficiently common in
the middle of the ninth century to furnish Photius with one of
his accusations against the Western Church23 and its presence
in the manuscript, though showing that the latter was adapted,
in this respect, to local custom, gives no sure indication as
to any particular locality.

On the other hand, the absence of any notice of the Rogation
Days may be taken as evidence that the Gallican influence was
not strong in the district to which the manuscript belongs ⁸ 2
while the presence of the prayers sor the Great Litany of
April 25, with mention of the Roman ‘ stations,' points to the
following, in this respect, of the Roman custom. A similar
inference may be drawn from the list of saints mentioned in the
Proprium Sanctorum. Here also it would appear that Roman,
rather than Gallican, usage has determined the local practice,
and influenced the local kalendar.

The points in the Proprium Sanctorum which suggest Galli·
