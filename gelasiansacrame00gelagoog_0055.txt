THE S. GALLEN MS. (S.) xlvii

April 11, which is the date indicated as that of his ‘deposition’
in the Liber Pontzficalis (vol. i. p. 239), and probably the date
intended in the inscription cited by M. Duchesne, in the notes
to his edition of the same work (Liber Pontificalis, vol. i. p. 379,
note 35), where the name of the month is omitted. The festival
of All Saints is not noticed, that of S. Caesarius being alone
mentioned on Nov‚ 1. The mention of SS. Chrysanthus and
Daria is not on Oct. 25, but on Nov. 29, where they (with
S. Maurus) are joined, as in the Vatican MS„ in the same com-
memoration with S. Saturninus ln connexion with this juxta-
position it may perhaps be worth while to note the restoration
by Adrian I of the basilica of S. Saturninus ‘una cum cyme-
terio sanctorum Crisanti et Dariae ' (Lib. Pontifi, vol. i. p. 509).
Other saints’ days mentioned in S., but not in M. Battifol's
list, are SS. Emerentiana and Macarius (Jan. 23); S. SotheriS,
and SS. Zoticus, Irenaeus, and Hyacinthus (Feb.·10); SS.
vitalis, Felicula, and Zeno (with S. Valentinus on Feb. 14);
S. juliana (Feb. 16); SS. Perpetua and Felicitas (March 7);
S. Juvenalis (May 3); the Dedicatio Ecclesiae beatae Mariae ad
Martyres (May 13); S. Vitus (june 15); S. Benedict (July 11);
the ‘ Maccabees ’ (Aug. 1, where mention is also made of the
veneration of S. Peter's chain's); S. Donatus (Aug. 7); S. Mag·
nus (Aug. 19), S. Rufus (Aug. 27); S. Priscus (Sept. 1);
S. Gurgonius (Sept. 9); S. Augustinus¹ (Nov. 17); and S. Da-
masus (Dec. 11). of these festivaIS, those os SS. Perpetua and
Felicitas and of S. Gurgonius appear in the Philocalian list of
‘ Depositiones Martyrum '3 that of the Maccabees was apparently
of general observance3 that of S. Augustinus appears to be the
festival of a Capuan martyr, who has been confused, at least by
the later scribe, with the Bishop os Hippo. All the remaining
names of SaintS‚ with the exception of S. Macarius, may be
connected with places in Italy, while some of them are certainly
Roman ². It may be noted also that the festival of S. Nico-
medes (June 1) and that of S. Michael (Sept. 29) are shown by
the titles of the S. Gallen MS. to be connected, like that of
