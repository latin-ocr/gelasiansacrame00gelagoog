xlviii INTROD UCTION.

S. Mary ad Μανζγνεε, with the anniversarios of the dedications
of churches at Rome: while the festival of the Purification has,
as in the Rheinau MS„ the title ⁶ S. Simeonis)

As in the Rheinau MS„ the Roman ‘ stations' are marked
throughout Lent‚ sor the Ember DayS‚ and also sor certain
festivals. The Secret has always the title ‘ Super oblata,' or
‘ Super oblatam '3 the Preface is marked only by the initials
of ‘ Vere Dignum,' having no separate title. The Lent missae,
as in the Rheinau Sacramentary, include missae for the Thurs-
days in each week.

Whether the S. Gallen Sacramentary originally agreed with
that of Rheinau in containing a ‘Liber secunduS‚' including the
Ordo Baptzlrterz'i, and other special offices and massae such as
those which occupy the latter part of the first and third books
of the Vatican MS„ we cannot now say: but it seems not un-
likely that this was the case. If SO, the loss os the Liber
secundus is the more to be regretted, since it seems that the
S. Gallen MS. was so constructed as to include forms for the
use os a bishop ¹. It might therefore have been expected (on
the theory already stated as to the significance of the words
‘Liber secundus de extrema parte ’ in the Rheinau MS.), that
the Liber secundus of the S. Gallen book, if it existed, would
have contained the forms of Ordination 'and other Episcopal
offices‚ and so have furnished material for comparison with the
text of the Vatican Sacramentary which is not supplied by the
contents of the Liber secundus os the Rheinau book.

But in what it now contains, the S. Gallen MS. does
supply the defects of that of Rheinau to a very considerable
extent. As we have seen, the Proprium Sanctorum of the
Rheinau Sacramentary is much less full than that of the S. Gal-
len: and the additional missae contained in the latter cover
a very large part of the second book of the Vatican MS. In
fact, there are only a very few sections of the Proprium Sanc-
torum of the Vatican Sacramentary which do not appear, either
in whole or in part, in the S. Gallen text. The precise extent
os the agreement between the two will, it is hoped, be suffi-
ciently shown by the marginal references appended to the text

name of S. Magnus may be connected the Oils and Chrism, and for the Recon-
with Anagni, and those of SS. Rufus and ciliation of the Penitents‚ which, as we*

⁶ Priscus with Capua. have seen, the Rheinau Sacramentary

¹ It contains the forms sor hallowing omits.
