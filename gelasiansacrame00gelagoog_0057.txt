IMPORTANCE OF R. AND S. xlix

of ‘the present volume, and by the scheme of the contents of
the S. Gallen manuscript, which will be found in the Appendix.

From what has already been said of the Rheinau and
S. Gallen SacramentarieS, it will appear that there are strong
grounds for regarding them as independent witnesseS. The
Rheinau manuscript shows traces of Gallican influence which are
absent from the S. Gallen manuscript: there is reason to think
that the two manuscripts were written in different localities:
they are not, indeed, very widely separated in date; but the
limited character which marks the Proprium Sanctorum of the
Rheinau manuscript may be taken as an indication that it was
copied from a text a good deal earlier than that employed by
the scribe of the S. Gallen manuscript. The amount of irregu-
larity of spelling and of grammar exhibited by the two, while it
is sufficient in each case to show that the text has not been much
affected by the movement for reform in these matterS, is so
much greater in the one than in the other as to supply a further
reason for regarding them as mutually independent: while this
view is also supported by the absence from one of prayers and
Prefaces contained in the parallel sections of the other. When
we compare them with the Vatican Sacramentary, hitherto
known as the ‘ Gelasian,’ we find that, taken together, they
include by far the greater part of its contente.. They differ from
it in the arrangement of the common matter: and the differences
of arrangement are by no means few or unimportant. But of
thece differences, and of the inferences to be drawn from them,
it will be more convenient to treat at a later stage. It is sufficient
here to note two facts: first, that the proportion of matter
common to these three Sacramentaries of the ‘ Gelasian ’ type is
very large; and second, that in cases where such common
matter is also found in the Sacramentaries of the later or
‘ Gregorian’ type, the three ‘ Gelasian ' Sacramentaries ¹ are very
often in agreement with one another, as against what appears to
be the later recension of the text, presented· by the ‘ Gregorian '
Sacramentaries.

For these reasons it would seem to be clear that in the task
of verifying or correcting the readings of the Vatican manu-
script, the two Sacramentaries of Rheinau and S. Gallen must,
as a general rule, be our principal authorities; though in some
