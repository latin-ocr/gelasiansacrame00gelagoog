cases their evidence may be set aside in favour of that supplied
by earlier authorities, such as the ‘ Leonine ³ Sacramentary‚ it
must outweigh that of the later Sacramentaries of the ‘ Gregorian ³
type, such as those edited by Pamelius or Menard, to which, as
the best authorities accessible in their time, Tommasi and Vezzosi
were naturally led to refer.

IV. The Bodleian MS. Bodl. Add. A. 173 has been occasion-
ally cited in the notes to the present volume, where it is denoted
by the symbol A. This manuscript also is described by
M. Delis1e¹, from notes furnished by Mr. F alconer Madan. It
is a small volume containing fifty-two parchment leaves, not
uniform in size. It is written in a Carolingian minuscule hand
which may be assigned to a date near·the end of the ninth cen-
tury. The phrase ‘ Christianum Francorum Romanorumque
imperium ’ in the Good Friday prayers, may be taken as evidence
that it was written in the Frankish kingdom, but there is nothing
else in the manuscript itself to show clearly the place where it
was written or used. It may be said to consist of four fragments,
each incomplete at the beginning and at the end, while there
are also several gaps in the first and fourth fragments The
missas contained in this manuscript are of the Gregorian, not of
the Gelasian type: but in some portions of its contents it
presents certain points of interest for the purpose of the present
edition. The peculiar form in which the Creed which it contains
was written by the original scribe shows several curious instances
of agreement with the text of the Vatican manuscript: and cer-
tain portions of the forms relating to Ordination, which make up
one os the fragments ², show a text closely agreeing with that of
the Codex Gellonensis‚ as cited by Martene.

V. Another Bodleian manuscript, formerly included in the
Canonici collection, now MS. Liturg. Miscell. 319, has also
furnished some material sor the notes of this edition, where it
is cited by the symbol Β. It is professedly a Gregorian Sacra-
mentary, and appears to have been once used at Aquileia,
since the later insertions in its Kalendar include the names of
certain Aquileian saints ³, and notices of the obits of six Patri-
