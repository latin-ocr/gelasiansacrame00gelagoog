archs of Aquileia. Its date may be after the year 1000, but is
probably before 1019 ¹. The manuscript is beautifully written
throughout, and contains some fine miniatures and illuminated
letters. The portions of its contents which have been used for
this edition are the mzlrsae for special purposeS, which include
several collects parallel to those in the Vatican manuscript, and
its order for the Burial of the Dead, which in several portions
agrees with the parallel orders in the Vatican and in the
Rheinau Sacramentaries.‘ .

VI. For one portion of the order sor the Burial of the Dead,
reference has been made to a manuscript Pontifical of English
use, of the twelfth century, which seems to have at one time
belonged to Hereford Cathedral. It is now in the Library of
Magdalen College, Oxford (MS. Magd. 226).

The use made os printed texts has been chiefly for the purpose
of comparison; but some of these texts have appeared to be
of sufficient value to be employed also for purposes of correction.
, Foremost among these is the text of the Leonine Sacramentary.
The references to this Sacramentary are to the columns of
Muratori’s Liturgia Romana Vetus, but the readings of his
edition have been compared with the more trustworthy text con-
tained in the second volume of the edition of S. Leo’s works
prepared by the Ballerini, in which every divergence from the
readings of the manuscript is professedly indicated in the notes.
Next in importance, as regards the use made of them, are the
Gallican Sacramentaries edited by Tommasi and Mabillon, and
the Ordines reproduced by Martene from certain early manu-
scripts. To the Gallican bookS, reference is made by the
columns of Muratori’s Liturgia Romana Vetus, but sor greater
security his readings have been compared, where that was possi-
ble, with the edition of Neale and F orbes ². For the Canon
Actionis recent collations of the parallel portion of the M issale
Francorum and the sacramentarium Gallicanum have been em-
ployed as well as the printed texts. Where the Rheinau and
S. Gallen manuscripts furnish no material sor comparison, recourse
has been had to early texts included in the second volume of
Gerbert’s M onumenta Vet. Lit. Alemanm'cae, and to Ordines
