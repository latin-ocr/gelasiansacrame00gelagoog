lii INTRODUCTION.

printed by Martene in his De A uliquis Ecclesiae Ritibus ¹. Some
use has also been made of the ‘Ambrosian ' text contained in the
first volume of Pamelius' Liturgicon Latinum ², of the Gregorian
text in Muratori’s Liturgia Romana Vetus, and of Mr. Warren’s
edition of the Leofric Missal ⁸.

Three other printed texts have been employed much more
largely, and their readings cited much more frequently. But the
purpose of the citations is rather that of comparison than of
emendation. They serve as the means of showing the relation
between the text of the Vatican manuscript and the kindred
texts of Rheinau and S. Gallen on the one hand, and the later ’
recension of the text on the other. These are the text contained
in Gerbert's Sacramentary, already mentioned, and the Gregorian
Sacramentaries edited by Pamelius ⁴ and Menard ⁵. The Sacra-
mentary of Menard is os some special importance, as it contains
a good deal of matter closely parallel to parts os the contents
of the third book of the Vatican manuscript, which find no place
in the Rheinau Sacramentary.

To attempt anything like a full discussion of the questions
relating to the history and development of the Roman Sacramen-
taries is not the purpose of this Introduction, and would be
beyond its scope. But it may be well, for the sake of clean-nem,
b'efore discussing the variations of the Rheinau and S. Gallen
Sacramentaries from the Vatican manuscript, or the points of
resemblance and of difference which they exhibit, as compared
with the Gregorian SacramentarieS, to state certain facts which
form the most important data os the general problem.

The Vatican manuscript itself furnishes us with evidence that
before the time of Charles the Great books bearing the title of
‘Liber Sacramentorum Romanae Ecclesiae ' were known and
used within the Frankish kingdom. It is itself one of these
books: and the fact that it contains a certain admixture of
Gallican elementS, and is clearly not a simple transcript of
a Roman book, may be taken as evidence, to a certain extent, os
