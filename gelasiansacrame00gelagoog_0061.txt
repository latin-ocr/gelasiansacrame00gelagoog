THE GREGORIAN SACRAM'ENTARIES. liii

the introduction of the Roman book stom which it is in the main
derived, at some time earlier than the date os the manuscript
itself. The Sacramentaries commonly known as Gallican, the
‘ Missale Francorum,’ the ‘ Missale Gothicum,’ the ⁶ Missale Gal-
licanum VetuS,² and possibly the ‘ Sacramentarium Gallicanum ¹,'
show signs of the influence of Roman books in the modification
of the Gallican rite within the Frankish dominions: but they
give us no evidence as to the name by which the Roman books
in question were known. The Rheinau manuscript, though
rather later, and though now possessing no title, may be taken as ’
another instance of a Frankish Sacramentary, in the main Roman,
and based to some extent on a Sacramentary closely akin to that
from which the Vatican manuscript is derived.

In the latter part of the eighth century, probably between 784
and 791, Pope Adrian Ι sent to Charles the Great, at his request,
a copy of the Roman Sacramentary in the shape which, as it
was believed, had been given to it by the revision of S. Gregory.
This forms the basis of the class of Sacramentaries known as

’ Gregorian, of which all the earliest specimens known to us

appear to have been written north of the Alps. The earliest
Gregorian Sacramentaries are all divided into two parts, which
are in some manuscripts separated by a list of the contents of
the second part, in others also by a short preface to the second
part, drawn up by the person to whose arrangement that portion
of the Sacramentary is to be assigned. In this preface it is
stated that the first part of the Sacramentary, which stands
before the preface, is (with certain specified exceptions) the
Sacramentary set forth by S. Gregory, while the second part,
which follows the preface, is a compilation from other source3‚
containing ‘ alia quaedam quibus necessario utitur sancta ecclesia‚’
which S. Gregory had omitted in his Sacramentary, in view of
the fact that they had been already set forth by otherS. The
second part is of the nature, in fact, of a supplement to the first
part, compiled from service books other than that ascribed to
S. Gregory. This preface, and therefore also the second part of
the Gregorian SacramentarieS, are sometimes ascribed to
Grimoldus‚ who was Abbot os S. Gallen from about 850 to 872:
but a more probable view is that expressed by the writer of the
