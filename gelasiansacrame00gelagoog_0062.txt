The desire of Charles the Great was to make the adoption of
the Gregorian Sacramentary universal and exclusive throughout
his dominionS‚ and it was no doubt partly with the view of
assisting such a general adoption that the second part, or supple-
ment, was added to the text surnished by Adrian, which, as we
may infer, did not contain all that was required. If, as seems
most likely, we may judge from the contente of the supplement
what Adrian’s copy of the Sacramentary left to be provided
from other sourceS, it would appear that what was sent to
Charloe' as the Roman Sacramentary of S. Gregory contained
no missae for ordinary SundayS, such as those after Epiphany
and after Pentecost, and no missae sor special purposes such as
those which are contained in the third book of the Vatican
manuscript. M. Duchesne argues that Adrian’s book was a
*copy of the Sacramentary prepared for the use of the Pope, and
included only the prayers for festivals and ‘ stational ' dayS‚ which
would be said by the Pope himself ². With the addition of the
supplement, however, the Gregorian Sacramentary was suitable
sor general use, and was accordingly generally adopted, accord-
ing to Charles' direction.

It was not, however, at once adopted so completely as to
exclude the use of the older Roman SacramentarieS, which we
find, in the ninth century, distinguished by the name of ‘ Gelasian.’
Thus in the Chronicle of the Abbey of S. Riquier, we find in an
inventory drawn up in 8 31, the following entry :—

‘ De libris sacrarii qui ministerio altaris deserviunt Missales
Gregoriani tres: Missalis Gregorianus et Gelasianus modernis
temporibus ab Albino ordinatus i: Lectionarii Epistolarum et
Evangeliorum mixtim et ordinate compositi v: Missales Gela-
siani xix ³.’

Here the ‘ Missales Gregoriani ’ are no doubt some of the
copies of Adrian’s book which were multiplied and distributed,
under Charles’ direction, soon after its reception: the ‘ Missalis
