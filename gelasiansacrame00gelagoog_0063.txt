C ONT IN UANCE oF ‘ GELASIAN ’ BOOK S. lv

Gregorianus et Gelasianus . . . ab Albino ordinatus' is most
probably a copy of the Gregorian Sacramentary including the
supplement: if se, we have here a confirmation os the view which
ascribes that supplement to Alcuin. The ⁶ Missales Gelasiani,’
far more numerous, are Sacramentaries of the older type, of
which it is expraesly said that they are among the ‘libri sacrarii ’
and employed in the service os the altar.

Le Brun, in commenting on this passage, notes it as an
argument in favour of the view that the Benedictines retained
the older or ‘ Gelasian ' Sacramentary after the introduction of
the Gregorian ¹. But its retention was not confined to the
monastic communitiesss In a record of a diocesan visitation by
Hincmar of Rhenus, held probably about the year 850, we find,
in the inventories of books belonging to parish churches‚ the
mention os ‘ Gelasian ’ as well as of ‘ Gregorian’ missals ι in
one case the only missal of the church seems to have been
‘ Gelasian ’Β

How long the use of the ‘ Gelasian ’ Sacramentary continued,
’ side by side with that of the Gregorian, can hardly be determined.
But the evidence of the triple Sacramentary used by Gerbert
would seem to show that in the tenth century the ‘ Gelasian '
rite was still not a mere survival, but was so far in ,practical use
as to rank, sor the purposes of the compiler of that collection,
which can hardly be supposed to have been merely antiquarian,
with the Gregorian and Ambrosian rites. Traces os its partial
use may also be found. Thus in a Poitiers Pontifical, cited by
Mai-tene, who supposed it to have been written about the year
900, we find provision for the possibility os the loesom on Easter
Even being either ‘secundum Gelasium ’ or ‘ secundum Gre-
gorium ³,’ while in another manuscript mentioned by Vezzosi,
certain Missae Dominicales (presumably a series such as that in

made above. (Hist. Jahrb. vol. xiv.

term ‘Gelasian’ must have been, in
popular as well as in learned use,
applied to the Missals (or Sacramen-
taries) of the older type.
