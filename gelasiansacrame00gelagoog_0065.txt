THE BODLEIAN FRAGMENT. lvii
apparently is ‘so far ‘ Gregorianized ' as to have led to its being
classified, as M. Delisle tells us, as ‘ Missale vetus ex Gelasiano
et Gregoriano mixtum?

In addition to these manuscripts mention may be made of
a fragment,hitherto unnoticed‚ in the Bodleian Library at Oxford ¹.
This is of very small extent, consisting only of portions of four
leaveS, which seem to have been used in the old binding of one
of the printed books of the Douce collection, and to have been
rescued from that position by Mr. Douce when the volume was
rebound, and attached to one of the ily-leaves. They have now
been removed from this situation, and bound up in a separate
cover.. The fragment contains part of the Missa Cknkmaltlr
(including a portion of the Exorcism and Preface which are to
be found on p. 72 of the present work), the end of the missa for
the night of Easter Even, and part of that for Easter Day, parts
of the missa and other prayers for the Nativity of S. John
Baptist, and of the missae for the vigil and the festival of
55. John and Paul, the latter part of the missa for the sixth
’ Sunday after Pentecost, and the heading of that for the vigil of
55. Peter and Paul. The sections, as in the Vatican manuscript
and the .Angouleme Sacramentary, appear to have been num-
bered, and the Roman ‘ station ' for Easter Day is noted in the
heading of the mirsa- The order of the prayers agrees exactly
with that of the S. Gallen manuscript, while the readings of the
text, save for some minor variations os spelling, agree very
closely with those of the first hand in the same manuscript ².

books, is not at the beginning, but at the
end of the Proprium and Commune. It
may be noted that the second part of the
book contains a series of Episcopal Bene·
dictions such as that which, as already
suggested, may be referred to iu the
heading of the ‘ second book ’ of R. M.
Delisle assigna the Angouleme Sacra-
mentary to the latter past of the eighth,
or the beginning of the ninth, century,
apparently inclining to the later date,
which he gives in the list of manuscripts
appended to his text. Another manu·
script, now lost, which is mentioued by
M. Delisle, was probably of the Gelasian
class—a ‘ Liber sacramentorum Romanae
Ecclesiae ⁹ written in silver letters on
purple parchment, which perished when
the Library of Strasburg was destroyed in

1870 (Μόνη. sur d’Anc. Sacram„ pp.
89-91).

¹ MS. Douee, f. 1. A ‘collotype’ fac-
simile of one page of the fragment (fol. 3
verso) is included in the present volume.

² One exception may be noticed. In
the Prefaee which stands at the end of
the Missa chrismalis (see p. 7² infra)
the fragment reads, ⁴ Qui mysterium (sic)
tuorum secreta revelans pacificum nemus
ore columbe gestatum,’ διο. This differs
from the reading of S¹. by the insertion
of the word ‘ pacificum‚’ but supports the
reading of ⁸ nemus’ found in V. and S¹.,

and adopted in the text iu preference to ⁰

⁸ munus,' which is substituted by S ⁸. The
change is no doubt due to the corrector’s
failure to understand the original word,
which is used in a rather rare sense.
