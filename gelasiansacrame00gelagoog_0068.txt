lx INTRODUCTION.

bling R. or S„ it becomes more probable that his statement
was based simply on a comparison os what in his own day was
known as the ‘ Gelasian ³ Sacramentary with what was known
as the Gregorian, and therefore less likely that his statement
expresses an early tradition, uncoloured by the opinion of the
writer or his contemporaries. The question seems, however, to
be rendered more difficult, whatever view we take as to the
character of the ‘ Gelasian codeX,’ by his mention of another
point with regard to S. Gregory's work. If the words ‘ nonnulla
vero superadiciens' stood by themselve3‚ they might apply to
either os the supposed caseS, at least as exactly as the phrases
‘ multa subtrahens ’ and ‘ pauca convertens.⁹ But it is difficult
to see how the phrase ‘ nonnulla vero superadiciens pro expo-
nendis evangelicis lectionibus ' is to be explained as a reference
to anything contained in the Gregorian Sacramentary as we
have it now, or as we know it to have been received before
the time at which John the Deacon wrote. Possibly an
explanation might be found by a comparison of the degrees in
which the Gelasian and Gregorian books serve by their arrange-
ment to illustrate the Liturgical GospeIS. But it seems also
possible that we have here an indication that John’s statement
does not rest simply on the impression which he had formed of
the comparative contents of the ‘ Gelasian ’ and ‘ Gregorian '
codices of his own day, but in part depends upon some source
of information now unknown to us, as to the actual work of
S. Gregory ¹.

The only authority, therefore, which can be alleged with
certainty for the use of the term ‘ Gelasian‚’ as applied to the
class of Sacramentaries which includes V„ R„ and S„ is to be

¹ It may be worth while to notice the
fact that Bede, writing at a date much
nearer to S. Gregory’s own time than
either John the Deacon or walafrid
StrabO, and dwelling at some length

mention of his compilation of a ‘ Liber
Sacramentorum,’ though here also we find
mention of the addition to the Canon.
But the resemblance between Bede's

account of S. Gregory and the account

 

 

upon the literary labours of S. Gregory,
does not attribute to him either the for·

mation or the revision of a Sacramentary,
though he does mention the addition
which S. Gregory is said to have made
to the clause ‘ Hauc igitur oblationem ’ in
the Canon of the Mass. Nor does the
Liber Pomfficalis, which briefly passer·
over S. Gregory’s literary work, make any

in the Liber Pomificalis is sufficiently
strong to suggest that there may be a
close relationship between the two, which
would account for the non-appearance in
the one ol* what is omitted in the other.
John the Deacon seems to have used
other sources of information, independent
os either account.
