COMPARISON OF R. AND S. WJTH V. lxi

found in the fact that such Sacramentaries were actually dis-
tinguished by this name while they were still in use, and that,
in accordance with this usage, certain formS, such as the
lessons on Easter Even, agreeing with the order prescribed in
these SacramentarieS‚ were also described as ‘ secundum Gela-
sium? The usage may have been the result of an early
tradition as to their origin3 but we cannot be certain that this
was so. It may, as M. Duchesne supposes, have sprung up in
the eighth or ninth century, when it was desired to distinguish
the older form of Sacramentary from that which bore the name
of S. Gregory‚ and have owed its origin to the tradition pre·-
served in the ‘ Liber Pontificalis,’ that S. Gelasius was the
author of ‘ prefaces and prayers ¹.' In any case, it would have
been admitted by those who used the term that the whole
‘ Gelasian ’ Sacramentary, as they knew and used it, had not pro-
ceeded from S. Gelasius: and it is hard to think that, is there had
been a general belief, in the early part of the eighth century,
that the main body of the ‘ Gelasian' Sacramentary, apart from
certain things obviously of much more recent origin, was really
due to S. GelasiuS, the compilet of the supplement to -the
GregorIan Sacramentary would have refrained from citing the
authority of S. Gelasius for the forms which he transferred from
the older Sacramentaries to his own compilation, and would
have been content, as he was content, to state in his intro-
ductory preface that his material was drawn from the work of
authorities other than S. Gregory. ἡ

For the use of the term in our own day, and especially sor
its use as applied to the Vatican manuscript, we may plead not
only the usage of the time when these Sacramentaries were still
employed, but the current use of liturgical scholarS. The name
is a convenient one, so long as we do not use it as a ‘ question-
begging epithet ἐ it has, ever since Tommasi’s time, been
generally applied to the one Sacramentary of this class which
has been really known to students of the Western LiturgieS,
and it would be unreasonable, unless some clear advantage
could be expected from a change, to attempt to alter the title
by which the book has so long been known.
