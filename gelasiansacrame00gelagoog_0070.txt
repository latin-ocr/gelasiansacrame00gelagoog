perhaps the first point which strikes our attention is the absence
in the latter of the division into three books, which marks the
earlier manuscript, and which waS, in the eyes os its first editor,
a weighty argument in favour of the identity os that manuscript
with the Sacramentary of S. GelasiuS. If we assume that the
early Roman Sacramentary which furnished the basis of V. was
divided, like V. itself, into three books, of which the first con-
tained the partially developed Proprium de Tempore, the second
the Proprium Sanctorum and Commune Sanctorum ¹, and the
third a series of unappropriated Sunday missae with the Canon
Actionis and certain missae in quouziiamk diebus, we find on
turning to R. and S. that these three divisions have been com-
bined, augmented, and in part revised. The Proprium de
Tempore has been developed by the appropriation of the missae
Domim‘cales to particular Sundays, and by the addition of other
Sunday missae assigned to Sundays not provided sor by this
appropriation3 the Proprium Sanctorum has also received addi-
tions, and no longer forms a separate division, but is broken up,
and its parts interspersed with the Sunday missae. The group
of Sunday missae being thus removed from their position
immediately before the Canon Actionis, the missae quotidianae
are moved into that place, so that the Canon, with its attendant
series of Postcommunions and Benedictions super Populum,
stands at the end of the whole collection. Thus the whole of
the Sacramentary has received a certain amount os rearrange-
ment, and almost all its parts show a certain amount of change
in their position. ⁴

But the process os rearrangement has not been confined to
this general shifting of material. There has been also, it would
seem, in many cases, a roemngement of the contents of par-
ticular portions. Thus, while the greater part of the prayers
which in V. make up the missae from Christmas to the
Epiphany are found also in the corresponding portion of R.
