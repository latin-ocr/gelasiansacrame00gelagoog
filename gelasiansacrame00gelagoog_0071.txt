 

RESEMBLANCES OF R. ΛΝΒ S. To GREGORIAN BOOK S. lxffi

and S., they there appear in a different order: so also with the
prayers which in V. make up the missae from Easter to Pente-
eost, and so again with the Advent missae and with the prayers
of the mats-sae for the Ember seasons. The case is the same, in
several instances‚ with the prayers for particular festivals in the
Sanctorale, while here we also find that in R. and S. some os
the missae which form the Commune Sanctorum of V.¹ have
been assigned to particular festivaIS, and the Commune Sanc-
torum has been reconstructed. The mirsae for the whole of
Lent and Advent have been revised and rearranged, those sor
Septuagesima, Sexagesima, and Quinquagesima have been
slightly altered. As a general rule, the form of the missa in
R. and S. corresponds with that which we find in V.: each
missa, that is to say, contains two Collects before the Secret:
many are also provided with a Preface ¹, and with a Benedictio
super Populum. But while R. and S. thus preserve, in the
structure of their missae, the characteristic features of the
‘ Gelasian ' Sacramentary, the general result of the revision is
such that the individual missae are brought into closer agree-
ment with the Gregorian mis-sae for the same days than those
of V. Looking merely at the prayers contained in a particular
missa of R. or S., as they stand in Gerbert’s text, and com-
paring them with those of the corresponding missa in the
Gregorian Sacramentary of Muratori, we might often be dis-
posed to think that the missa os R. or S. had been constructed
by simply adding to the Gregorian mels-sa such forms as were
needed to make up a missa of the ‘Gelasian’ type: or, if we
chose to look at the matter from another point of view, we
might say that the Gregorian missa seems to have been formed
from the ‘ Gelasian ' missa of R. or S. by simply discarding the
forms which were not required in a missa of the Gregorian
type. Is, however, we take the differences of readings presented

in R„ and still more in S., is a feature in common to both manuscripts. Even so,

The number in R. is less than in S.; for those os V. in the proportion of neany

omits in many cases a Prefaee contained gorian Sammentaxies.
