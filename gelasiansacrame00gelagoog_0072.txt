lxiv INTRODUCTJON.

by the different Sacramentaries into account, the question of
the relation of R. and S. to V. on the one hand, and to the
Gregorian Sacramentary on the other, will sometimes appear,
even in such cases, to be rather more intricate. If, in addition
to this, we further consider the fact that R. and S. contain many
missae which, while they owe, or seem to owe, some part of
their contents to the Gregorian Sacramentary, are for the most
part composed of prayers which find no place in the first por-
tion of that Sacramentary, but can be traced in V„ and contain
also other missae which are not represented in the Gregorian
Sacramentary at all, it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion
that the type of Sacramentary represented by R. and S. rests,
at least to a very large extent, and probably as its principal
foundation, upon a Roman Sacramentary very closely allied to
that which forms the basis of the text os V. On the other
hand, it can hardly be doubted that this later type of ‘ Gelasian ’
Sacramentary is closely related to that other recension of the
Roman Sacramentary which is represented by the first portion
os Muratori's Gregorian text ¹.

The use which is made in R. and S. of the material furnished
by the Advent missae of V. may be seen, to some extent, from
the notes appended to those missae (Book 11, sections lxxx-
lxxxv, pp. 214—223). But it may be worth while, as an illustra·
tion of what has been said; to examine the result, as it appears
in R. and S., in comparison with the parallel portion of Mura-
tori’s Gregorian text.

The two ‘ Gelasian ’ books contain five missae for the Sundays
before Christ-mas: Muratori's Gregorian text has only four. In
S. each of the five missae has a Preface: the Gregorian missae
have none, and those of S. are not all contained in V. The
Collects, Secret, and Postcommunion of the first marsa in R.
and S. are all found in V.: the two Collects are also found in
the Aliae orationes de Adventu of the Gregorian text: as
regards readings, 5ι and R. preserve in one of these two Col-
lects the reading of V., in the other they agree with the

² The Gregorian Sacramentary edited ment, and did not form part of the
by Pamelius containS, in its first portion, reoeusiou which the compiler attributed
a luge amount of material common to to S. Gregory. The relation of this
R. and S. But much of this material, as added matter to the ‘ Gelasian ’ Sacra-
it would seem, has been inserted by the mentaries is the sameas that of the sup-
same hand which compiled the supple· plement.
