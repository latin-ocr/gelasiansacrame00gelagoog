SEPTUAGESJMA MISSAE OF R. ΛΝΒ S. lxv

Gregorian text, and differ from V. The Secret and Postcom-
muuion are not in the Gregorian text. In the missae for the
other four Sundays R. and S. agree with the Gregorian text as
to the first Collect, Secret, and Postcommunion3 some of these
prayers are not contained in V. On the other hand, the second
Collect in each os the four missae is to be found in V.‚ while
none of them is contained in the Gregorian text. The two
‘ Gelasian ' books contain a series of mztesae ‘ quotidianis diebus?
which is not to be found either in V. or in the Gregorian text:
the greater part of the prayers of which the missae are made up
are contained in V.‚ and most of them are absent srom the
Gregorian text. The same is the case with the series os addi-
tional Advent collecta. The missae for the Ember days, while
differing from the parallel series both in V. and in the Gregorian
text, have more in common with the former than with the latter.
There are some cases, in this portion of R. and S., of prayers in ·
which the text of the later ‘ Gelasian ’ manuscripts shows agree-
ment with that of the earlier, where they differ from the Gre-
gorian text: but the instances are few, and the points of
agreement or difference somewhat slight.

The missae of V. for Septuagesima and the two following
Sundays are found in R. and S. with but little change. Each

of them hae, in the later manuscripts, a proper Presace: the ο

Presace for Sexagesima appears elsewhere in V.‚ while all three
find a place in the supplement to the Gregorian Sacramentary,
in a form corresponding‚ on the whole, rather to that which is
given to them by the second hand of S. than to that in which
they are to be found in R. Apart from these PresaceS, there
is not much to connect the missae of R. and S. with the
Gregorian text. One prayer is common to R.‚ S., and the
Gregorian in each of the three missae. In that for Septua-
gesima, the Super Populum of R. and S. is identical with the
Collect of the Gregorian missa: it is found elsewhere in V.‚
which here has no Super Populum ¹. In the missae for Sexagesima
aud Quinquagesima, R. and S. adopt, as the first collect, the
Collect os the Gregorian missa, and transfer to the second
place the Collect which stands first in the missa os V. This
is perhaps more to be noted in the case of the Sexagesirna

¹ The title Super Populum is in V. Populum is probably due to this elerical
prefixed to what is obviously the Post· error os the scribe, which hus been cor·
communion: the absence οἱ a Super reeted in the text of this edition.
