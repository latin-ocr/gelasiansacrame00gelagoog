missa, where the peculiar significance of the Gregorian Collect
depends upon the Roman usage, which made the ‘station ' that
day at the church of S. Paul, and where the remaining prayers
of the missa are not found in the Gregorian text ¹.

The missae of the Sundays of Lent in R. and S. present
fewer points of comparison with V., since in that manuscript the
missae for the ‘Scrutinies' are assigned to the third, fourth,
and fifth Sundays: these mtksae are to be found also in R., but
not assigned to the same, or indeed to any particular days².
In the mis-sa which R. and S. assign to the first Sunday of
Lent, the first Collect is the same, with a slight variation, as in
Muratori’s Gregorian text, the second the same as the first
Collect of V., the Secret is common to V. and to the Gregorian,
the Posteommunion is in the Gregorian missa but not in V.,
while the Super Populum is the same as in V.‚ not appearing in
Muratori’s Gregorian text, but being found in the Codex Otto-
bonianus. For the second Sunday, the first Collect is Gregorian,
while the remaining prayers agree with V. ; the Posteommunion
appears elsewhere in the Gregorian books, and the Super
Populum is in the missa for the same day in the Codex Otto-
bonianus. For Palm Sunday, the whole of the prayers of R.
and S., with the exception of the Posteommunion, agree with
the missa in V. The first Collect is common to the Gregorian,
and the Super Populum, once more, is in the missa of the
Codex Ottobom‘anus. The Posteommunion, which is not Gre-
gorian, occurs elsewhere in V. Turning to those Sundays for
which V. employs the missae for the ‘ Scrutinies‚’ we find that
in R. and S., on the third Sunday, the first Collect agrees with
the Gregorian missa, and the Super Populum with that of the

have been marked by the compilet as
not belonging to the Gregorian recension.

² Dr. F. Probst‚ in his recent work on
the Roman Sammentarioe, treats the
presence of these missae on the third,
fourth. and fifth Sundays of Lent as part
of the original Gelasian arrangement, and
supposes them to have been discarded in
R. and S., infavour of new missae borrowed
for the most part from the Gregorian
Sacramentary. (Probst, Dic &lieston

Rb'mz'scloen Sacramentarien und Ordines,
p. 163.) As against this view it may be
remarked. that the missae for the ‘ Scru-
tinies ⁹ are not of the Gelasian type,
having only a single Collect: and that
it is quite possible that the proper missae
for the Sundays have been discarded in V.
in· order to insert in their place the mae'ssae
for the ‘Scrutiniesl In this case, we
cannot teu how far the Sunday missae of
R. and S. agreed with those of the older
Gelasium Sacmmentary. They are not
(with one exception) in very close agree·
ment with the missae for the same Sundays
in the Gregorian Sacmnenmy.
