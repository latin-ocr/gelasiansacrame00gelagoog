FERIAL MISSAE oF LENT IN R. AND S. lxvii

Codex ottobonianus: the second Collect, Secret, and Postcom-
munion appear in other Gregorian missae, while the last is also
found in V., but is assigned to another day. For the fourth
Sunday, all but the Super Populum agree with Muratori’s ⁴
Gregorian text, the Secret appearing elsewhere in. V., while the
Super Populum is the same as the Postcommunion of the missa
sor the ‘ Scrutiny.' For the fifth Sunday, all the prayers are
contained in the Gregorian Sacramentary, but only the first
Collect is common to the Gregorian missa sor the Sunday:
no part of the missa is found in V. Possibly the small pro-
portion of agreement which the missae for these three Sundays
show with the contents of V. may be due to the suppression in
V. of the mels-sae with which they might have been expected to
agree: sor whatever reason, the amount of their contents which
canbe traced in V. is much less than in the case of the missae
sor the other Sundays of Lent ¹. Each of the Sunday missae
of R. and S. contains a proper Preface3 these appear, with more
or less variation, in the supplementary part of the Gregorian
Sacramentary.

The mals-sae for the week-days of Lent in R. and S. differ
from the series in V., in the first place by the addition of a missa
for the Thursday in each week. It was perhaps the intro-
duction of the Thursday ‘ station ² which gave occasion sor
a rearrangement os the whole of this portion of the Sacra-
mentary. The Thursday missae of R. and S. are, for the most
part, made up of prayers which occur elsewhere in V. The
same, indeed, may be said of most of the week-day missae:
but, in many of them, some prayers are included which do not
appear in V., and which do occur, though not always in the
same position, in the Gregorian Sacramentary: while otherS,
common to V. and to the Gregorian bookS‚ are placed in R.
and S. in the same position which they occupy in the Gregorian
text. In some instanceS‚ however, even where this is the case,
the readings os R. and S. agree with V. where the Gregorian
text shows a difference from the latter manuscript. The
structure, and the apparent source of the missae of R. and S.
may perhaps be most conveniently shown by the following
