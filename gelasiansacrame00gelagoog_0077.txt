It will be seen from the table that only one of the missac of
V. appears as a whole in R. and S„ that, namely, sor the
Saturday before the first Sunday of Lent‚ a day for which the
Gregorian Sacramentary provided no missa. With regard to
the other days, it would seem that, as a general rule, the first
Collect is the same as the Collect os the Gregorian Sacra-
mentary: but the rule is not by any means absolute.

In the heading of each os the Lent missae of R. and S. (with
the exceptions of the second Sunday and of the Saturday before
Palm Sunday) there is mention os the Roman church at which
the ‘ station ’ for the day was held. The list, as may be seen
from the Appendix (pp. 325-333)‚ differs but slightly from that
which is furnished by the Gregorian Sacramentaries of Pamelius
and Muratori. It seems to differ in regard to the Thursday of
the first week, where the Gregorian Sacramentaries mention the
church of S. Laurence ‘ foris murum ἐ but Pamelius’ marginal
note seems to indicate that his manuscript, or some other autho-
rity which he employed, was in practical agreement with the
heading as given in R„ and that ‘ foris murum’ is an erroneous
reading, arising from a misunderstanding of the title ‘ ad
F ormonsum ’ or ‘ ad F ormosum.’ A more important divergence
is that with regard to the Monday of Holy Week, where R. and
S. mention the church os SS. Nereus and AchilleuS, agreeing in
this point with the list in the second volume of Mabillon’s
Museum Italicum, but differing from the Sacramentaries of
Muratori and PameliuS, which, like the present Roman Missal‚
place the ⁸ station ' at the church of S. PraxedeS.

An exact comparison of the missae for the Ember days, and
os the prayers ‘in xii. Lectionibus‚’ is rendered difficult by the
fact that in these portions of their contents there is a certain
