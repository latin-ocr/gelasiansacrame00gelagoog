SUNDA Y MISSAE OF R. ΛΝΒ S. lxxi

overlaps the mis-sae for the Sunday after the Ascension‚ and for
Pentecost. The second book contains the Advent missae. The ‚
series in the third book consists of sixteen missae not appro-
priated to any particular Sunday, but answering to the missae
Dominicales which we find in some of the Gallican Sacramen-
tarieS. Whether the method of leaving these missae unappro-
priated was adopted in the Roman Sacramentary used by the
compilet of V., or was an adaptation of the material furnished
by that Sacramentary to the Gallican usage, we can hardly say
with certainty. But in R. and S. we find a full arrangement of
messae appropriated to particular Sundays. There are two for
Sundays after ChristmaS, six for Sundays after Epiphany‚ the
series from Septuagaeima to Easter‚ four for the Sundays ‘ post

· Octavas Paschae,’ one for the Sunday after the Ascension, and

a series os twenty-seven for the Sundays after Pentecost‚ begin-
ning with that for the octave: there are also, as we have seen,
five missae for the Sundays before Christmas, answering to the
five Advent missae of V. Those with which we are now con·
cerned are the mis-sae for the Sundays from Christmas to
Septuagesima‚ and from Pentecost to Advent. The first of
these divisions is not covered by any series in V.: it was no
doubt intended that the missa for any of these Sundays should
be taken from the series in the third book. In the supple-
mentary portion of the Gregorian Sacramentary, we have a long
series os Sunday missae appropriated to particular days. Those
from Christmas to Septuagesima agree with the missae for the
same Sundays in R. and S., but with certain differences of
structure. The missae of R. and S. have in each case two
Collects and a Benediction Super Populum, and also a proper
Preface. The second Collect, the Preface‚ and the Super
Populum have no place in the Gregorian missac. The Prefaces
of R. and S. for these Sundays appear with variations in the
supplementary part of Pamelius’ Gregorian text. Of the eight
prayers Super Populum all are found elsewhere in the supple-
mentary part of Muratori's Gregorian Sacramentary‚ while three
are found also in V. Os the eight second Collects three have
not been found in Muratori's Sacramentary‚ or in V., while five
appear elsewhere in the supplementary part of Muratori’s text,
two of these being found also in the first portion of that text,
and two appearing also in V.

For the Octave os Pentecost R. and S. agree in adopting the
