missa assigned to the same day in V., and in ignoring the totally'
different missa provided for it (as the Sunday following the
Pentecost Ember days) in the first portion of the Gregorian
Sacramentary. For the Sunday following, they adopt the missa
which V. assigns to the sixth Sunday ‘ post clausum Paschae.’
This missa also furnishes, in the supplementary part of Mura-
tori’s text, the Collect, Secret and Postcommunion which make
up the Gregorian missa for what is there called the first Sunday
after Pentecost ¹. But it is to be observed that R. and S. take
the whole missa, including the Super Populum, as it stands in
V., so that this Sunday is in R. and S. provided with a Super
Populum, a feature which is wanting in their remaining minae
for the Sundays after the Octave of Pentecost. The next
Sunday missa of R. and S. agrees with that for the Sunday
after the Ascension ² in V., save for the omission of the Super
Populum: the parallel missa in Muratori’s text has the same
collect, Secret, and Postcommunion. Next come, in R. and S„
three missae to which V. does not contain any parallel. The
first Collect, Secret, and Postcommunion in each case agree with
the corresponding missa in Muratori’s text. One of the second
Collects is found elsewhere in the supplementary part of the
Gregorian Sacramentary ; the two others have not been identi-
fied either in that Sacramentary or in V. A few of the prayers
of these three missae are found in V., and three, not contained
in V., are found in the first portion of the Gregorian Sacra-
mentary.

With the seventh Sunday after Pentecost in R. and S„ or the
sixth Sunday after Pentecost, according to Muratori’s text, we
reach a set of mis-sae corresponding on the whole to the first

part of the series contained in the third book of V. As
a general rule R. and S. take, in these mis-sae, the whole missa

given in V., adding a Preface, while the Gregorian text simply
discards the second Collect of V., R. and S. ; but in a few cases
R. and S. substitute for the Secret or Postcommunion of V.
another prayer: in these cases R., S., and the Gregorian text
agree. In two cases the Gregorian text discards the first
