SUNDA Y MISSAE OF R. AND S. lxxiii
Collect of V., R„ and S.‚ and has the second Collect instead ¹:
in one case the second Collect of R. and S. differs from that
of V., 3ηά is not found either in V. or in the Gregorian text of
Muratori.

The missae for the two Sundays between the seventeenth and
the twentieth after Pentecost in R. and S. are not taken from
the series in V., but correspond in part to those given in the first
part of the Gregorian Sacramentary for the Sundays which
precede and follow the Ember days of September, having of course,
in addition to the forms contained in the Gregorian text, a second

Collect and a Preface in each case. The missa for the Sunday
after the Ember days, however, agrees with the Gregorian mals-sa
only in respect os the first Collect: the second Collect is found
elsewhere in the first part of the Gregorian text, the Secret and
Postcommunion are found elsewhere in V., but not in Muratori's
Gregorian Sacramentary. With the twentieth Sunday R. an'd
S. return to the mals-sae of the third book os V. ², and continue to
follow the course os that series until it is exhausted with the
missa sor the twenty-fourth Sunday. For the twentieth Sunday
R. and S. discard the second Collect of the missa in V., and
substitute sor it that which is the Collect of the parallel
Gregorian missa. For the twenty-first, twenty-third, and
twenty-fourth Sundays they differ from V., and are in agree-
ment with the Gregorian text in regard to the Postcom-
mumon.

The last three missae for the Sundays after Pentecost in R.
and S. are not parallel to any missae contained in V., though
here, as in the missae for the fourth, fifth, 3ηά sixth Sundays,
already mentioned, some of the prayers os which the missae are
composed are found in V. in some other position. On the other
hand, the last three missae os the Gregorian supplement are in
general agreement with the corresponding missae of R. and S.‚
save that the latter have, in each case, a second Collect and

¹ In one of these cases (that of the
eleventh Sunday after Pentecost according
to R. and S.‚ the tenth according to the
Gregorian text) the two Collects are
marked by 3 later hand in S. for παυς·
position by s copyist: in Gerbert’s text
(p. 155) we find them transposedt and
Muratori’s text adopt· that which the
corrector of S. makes the first, discnrding

” that which is first in R. and the original

text of S.

⁸ The missae in the supplementary
part os the Gregorian text continue this
series without any break, so that the
missa for the seventeenth Sunday in the
Gregorian text unsvers to that for the
twentieth Sunday iu R. and S.
