lxxiv INTRODUCTION.

a proper Preface: in one instance the Gregorian missa has as
its Collect that which stands second in R. and S„ the first
Collect of R. and S. not being found either in V. or in Muratori's
Gregorian text ¹. As in other cases already referred to, the
Prefaces assigned to the Sundays after Pentecost in R. and S.
are for the most part to be found, with a certain amount of
variation, in the supplement of the Gregorian Sacramentary:
and several of the second Collects of R. and S„ which are dis-
carded from the Gregorian missae, find a place in other parts
of the supplement. The variations of reading, in the. matter
common to the missae os V., R., S., and the Gregorian Sacra-
mentary, are seldom, so far as these missae are concerned, of
much importance3 in some caseS, especially in the PrefaceS,
R. and 5². show more agreement with V. than with the Gre-
gorian form ; in otherS, where they differ from V., the Gregorian
form is in agreement with the later and not with the earlier
‘ Gelasian.’
matter of this portion seems to show that the compilet of the
supplementary part os the Gregorian books drew the missae
which he provided for these Sundays from the later, not from
the earlier, form of the ‘ Gelasian ’ Sacramentary.

The main conclusions to which an examination and com-
parison of the contents of the three ‘ Gelasian ’ Sacramentan'es
which have been under consideration would seem to lead uS‚ are
these :—

1. That the Vatican manuscript, commonly called the ‘ Gela-
sian ’ Sacramentary‚ is in the main derived from an early Roman
Sacramentary, but incorporates some material drawn from

The general result of a comparison of the common

² The fuet that, in almost an cases
where a Gregorian missa agrees closely
with one contained in R. and S.. the
collect which stands second in the ‘ Gela·
sian ⁹ missa is that which is discarded in
the Gregorian suggests the theory that
the presence of two prayer-s before the
Secret in the Gelasian missa is due to
the retention‚ not of the oratio ad collec-
tam, but of a prayer answering to the
oratio super sindonem of the Ambrosinn
rite. If the first prayer were the oratio
ad collectam and the second the oratio ad
missam, we should rather expect that the
Gregorian missa would discard the first
and retain the second. 1t is true that in

some cases, where R. and S. have an
oratio ad collectam (the missac for the
Festival which they call ‘ S. Simeonis,⁸
and for Ash Wednesday, and that for the
Festival of S. Caesarius in S.)‚ they have
but one collect ad missam: but the cor—
respondence is here of such a kind as to
suggest that the ‘ Gregorian ⁹ missa has
b’een followed by R. and S.‚ with some
slight variation. In some σακε, the
second Collect of R. and S. actually
appears as the oratio super sindonem in
Pamelins’ Ambrosian text3 and nn exami-
nation of early Ambrosian missae may
perhaps furnish other evidence of the
same kind.
