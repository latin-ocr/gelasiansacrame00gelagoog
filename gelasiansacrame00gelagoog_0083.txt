GENERAL coNcL USIONS. lxxv ,

Gallican sources, while the Sacramentary from which it was
for the most part copied probably contained insertions and addi-
tions os a date later than the beginning of S. Gregory’s pontifi-
cate. The Vatioen manuscript itself certainly contains such
Gregorian or post-Gregorian elements.

2. If we are not to regard the differences in the structure of
particular mis-sae, as well as in the general arrangement of the
contents of the Sacramentary, which are exhibited by the com-
mon matter os R. and S„ as compared with the Vatican manu-
script, as being due to the compilet of V., and to departures, in
his work of compilation, from the order of the Roman Sacra·
mentary which he employed, we must consider that a revision
of the Sacramentary had taken place between the date of the
parent manuscript of V. and the date of the parent manuscript,

· or manuscriptS, of R. and S. As regards particular portions of

the contents of R. and 5., these manuscripts may be separated
from that which was the original source of V. by more than one

revision. The Lent missae, in particular, have apparently been
rearranged at some time later than the accession of Gregory 11.

3. The material contained in the second book of R. was
probably derived from a source closely akin to that which
furnished parts of the first and third books of V. Both in the
second book and in certain parts of the contents of the first
book R. shows signs os Gallican influence.

4. The revised ‘ Liber sacramentorum Romanae Ecclesiae ²
from which R. and S. are in the main derived, while sor the
most part preserving in its missae the form which is character-
istic of the ‘ Gelasian ' Sacramentaries, was in some respects
more nearly allied than the parent manuscript of V. to the
recension known as Gregorian, and represented by the first
portion of the Gregorian Sacramentaries ¹.

5. The mention of Roman churches which we fipd in the
headings of certain missae in R. and S„ though not sufficient
evidence to warrant the supposition that the missae in question

were actually taken from books in use at Rome, may be held to ·
show that the revision of the ‘ Gelasian’ Sacramentary was not

entirely independent of Roman influence‚ and may perhaps

¹ what ‘the precise relation between seems to require consideration, but to
the later ‘Gelasian’ Sacramentaries and belong rather to the history os the
the first portion os the ‘Gregorian’ Sacra· ‘ Gregorian ⁹ than of the ‘ Gelasian ’
mentasies may be, is a question which Sacramentary.
