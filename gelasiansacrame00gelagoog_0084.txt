lxxvi INTROD UCTION.

indicate that a Roman Sacramentary, of a date later than the
accession of Gregory 11, furnished part os the materials ern-
ployed in the revision ¹.

6. The use of the ‘ Gelasian ’ Sacramentary of the later type
was not confined to the churches of Gaul, but seems to have
existed also in the district of Rhaetia Curiensis. The S. Gallen
Sacramentary‚ which furnishes evidence of such use, contains
few, if any, distinct signs of Gallican influence.

7. The ‘ Gelasian ’ books of the type of R. and S. furnished to
the compiler of the supplementary part of the Gregorian Sacra-
mentary the most important por-tions of his text. In adopting
the missae, prefaces and prayers which he took from thern,
he appears either to have made some corrections and altera-
tions of the text, which were followed by the second hand of
the S. Gallen manuscript, or to have employed a text which
had been corrected and emended in the same way as the
S. Gallen Sacramentary.

The later ‘ Gelasian ’ bookS, therefore, may be said to form
a link between the recension of the Sacramentary represented
by V„ and the Gregorian Sacramentaries of that recension
which we now possess3 so far as regards the supplement, their
relation to the Gregorian books seems to be clear. But before
we can fully determine their importance in the history of the
Sacramentary, another question remains to be solved, the ques-
tion, that is to say, of their precise relation to the ‘Liber
Sacramentorum ’ sent by Adrian to Charles the Great. The
question is one which seems to have an important bearing on
the history os the Western Liturgy: but it probably requires,
for its full solution, not only some further study of material
already edited, but also some further examination and com-
parison of manuscripts. For such work, in both its brancheS, it

is hoped ‚that the present volume may prove to be a useful
instrument.

² The mention os the Roman ‘ stations’ have been inserted, had this not been the
for the Thau-‚days in Lent would hardly case.
