11.1xxxi.] ROMANAE ECCLESIAE. 215

lxxxiv were intended to correspond, though they have not in V. any separate
title, and appear (most likely by accident) as if they were additional Post-
communions for the last of the five Advent Missae. Gerbert's triple text fails
sor the greater part of the Advent semion, T. being defective at this point, and
Gerbert tells us that he used S. and R. sor the portion lacking in T. His text,
however, shows a few variations from the readings both of R. and S., and he
includes some things which are not contained in R. The contents and arrange·
ment of the five Missae differ to some extent. R. S. and Gerb. show two
Collects for each Missa, while Men. has only one: Men. has a ‘super
Populum ’ in each Missa, which R. S. and Gerb. have not: and there are some
variations in the text of the special Prefaces which S. Gerb. Men. agree in
assigning to each of the five Illissae. In the majority of the five. however, R.
S. and Gerb. are in agreement with Men. as to one collect, the Secret, and the
Postcommunion. Four out of the five Missae of V. show a marked corre—
s ondence with the Advent Missae of the sacramentarium Gallicanum and of
t e Missale Gallicanum Vetus. ² de adventum Domini, so V. The contents
of this Messa appear in different positions in the other books referred to.
(a) The first Collect has the same position in R. S. Gerb. Men. and appears in
the two Gallican books as the first prayer of the sust Missa de Adventu.
(b) The second Collect is in the Sacramentarium Gallicanum the second
prayer of the first Advent Missa: in R. S. Gerb. Men. it is the first Collect of
the Missa for the Sunda next before Christmas. (c) The Secret in R. S.
Gerb. Men. belongs to e third Sanday before Christmas. In Miss, Gall. it is
the ‘ Post Nomina ’ of the first Advent Missa. (d) The Presace is assigned by R.
S. Gerb. Men. to the fourth Sunday before Christmas: in both the Gallican
books it forms part of the first Advent Missa. (e) The Postcommunion is that of
the third Sunday before Christmas in R. S. Gerb. Men. and appears in Miss‚ Gall.
as the final ‘ Collectzb’ of the first Advent Missa. ⁸ promisisti usque in finem

whose names had preceded the ‘ Colle-ctio? ⁷ Miss. Gall. has this word in
the same isolated position, which led Mabillon to suspect an omission ; Sacr.
