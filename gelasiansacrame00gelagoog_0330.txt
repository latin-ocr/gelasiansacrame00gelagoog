238 LIBER SACRAMENTORUM [111. xvi.

In the former it is not written beyond Sanctus, Sanctum in the latter not
beyond Deus Sabaoth. '⁸ ac Sacr. Gall. ⁰ No crosses are marked at
this point in R.. or in Miss. Franc. ; S. has three (over the words dona, munera,
sacrificial 3 but they are perhaps a later addition. Sacr. Gall. has one, between
the words benedicas and haec. ⁹ pro tua sancta catholica ecclesia Miss-
Franc. ¹⁰ totum orbem Sacr. Gall. ¹¹ R. S. omit episcopo. In S. there
is a mark referring to the margin, after the words antistite nostro Iao. This
has been supposed to refer to some words written at the bottom of the page,
but these are not preceded by any mark corresponding to that in the body os
the text. It seems clear that the additional words added for insertion at this
point. to which the mark refers, were written at the top of the page, where the
lower part of the letters, preceded by the reference mark. can still be traoed,
though the upper part has been trimmed away. The words seem to have been
et omnibus orthodoxg atque apostolice fidei cultoribus. A similar addition may
be seen in V. where above papa nostro illo in one line. and above the Memento
which follows antistite nostro illo episcopo in the next, certain notae Tironianae
have been written between the lines of the original scribe. These have been
interpreted by M. Julien Havet‚ who considers the first of the additions to
represent the word superscribenda, and reads the second as follows: ‘ Et omni·
bus orthodoxis atque catholici fide cultoribus. Memento, Deus, rege nostro
cum omni populo? (See the third of the Plates accompanying Μ. Leopold
Delisle’s Ale‘moire sur d'Anciens Sacramentaires, and the explanatory note,
. 5.) As M. Delisle remarks, the Latinity of this insertion belongs to the
Kierovingian period τ it might be paralleled from other parts of the MS.‚ but is

show more variation ε the former has nna cum devotissimo (this word has been
elided) santulo tuo ill. papa nostro sedis apostolicae, et antistite nostro ill. et
omnibus orthodoxis atque catholicae et apostolicae fidei cultoribus. In Mis&
F rane. there is no mention of the Po e or the Bishop, and the clause runs una
cum omnibus orthodoxis atque a sto icae fidei cultoribus. ²² At this point
would be inserted the addition words which appear, as already stated, at the
bottom of the page in S. The words in question are written in red, in uncial
character,—Memento Domine famuli tui Remedii episcopi et 3 if they are not
actually by the original hand, they are by one almost os the same date. The
Remedius referred to is no doubt the Bishop who occupied the see os Chur in
the first years of the ninth century: he is perhaps mentioned here in his
character of a tempora] governor, in which case the insertion will be closely
parallel to the latter part of the insertion, already noted, in V. ¹³ R. inserts
Memento etiam Domine et animabus famulorum famularumque tuarum fide-
lium catholicorum in Christo quiescentium, qui nos praecesserunt, illorum et
illamm, qui per eleemoynam et consessionem. The clause is evidently not an
addition by a later hand, but (at least as it now stands) apparently an integral part
of the Canon. It may, os course, have been a marginal addition to the MS. from
which R. was copied. ¹⁴ Sacr. Gall. inserts at this point the variants for
the seasons os Christmas and Eas-ter, and proceeds Sed et: Miss. Franc. inserts
